This port was done in a matter of days by Tad Hunt, Eric van Hensbergen
and others when they were in the Lucent Inferno Business Unit, with a little
bit of advice from Vita Nuova about various Sparc details (since one
of us had done ports to micro-Sparcs).  It is included mainly to
allow another micro-Sparc port to be developed.   Javastation-1s
can still be found (but we haven't got one).  A good cheap reference
board would be good to have.

The Javastation running Java and JavaOS was sluggish; running Limbo
under Inferno it was actually quite snappy!
