The ipEngine-1 is a Motorola MPC8xx-based small computer
made by Bright Star Engineering (www.brightstareng.com)
which also provides Linux and their own operating system for it.
It is an interesting hardware platform to do network-oriented Inferno
applications.

The ipEngine is unusual in including an FPGA (Altera Flex 6016).
See fpga(3) and fpgaload(8).
We are also working on software to help program the thing.


Booting the ipEngine

0.	serial cable (port 1, 9600 baud), ether, power etc.

1.	make appropriate entries for your site in flash
	using the BSE monitor:

	set netmask 255.255.255.0
	set nameserver 200.1.1.11
	set server 200.1.1.11
	set serverip 200.1.1.11
	set gateway 200.1.1.50
	set hostname stella
	set domain vitanuova.com
	set myip 200.1.1.96

2.	add an entry to do the boot by tftp:

	set bootcmd "load /usr/inferno/os/ipengine/iipe 3000; go 3020"

	contrary to the BSE documentation this loads any
	binary file at the given address.  the -b option
	doesn't seem to be needed.

3.	reset
	it should load and start the kernel
