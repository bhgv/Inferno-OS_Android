Most of these files have been issued at some time under the Lucent Public License 1.02,
except devbench.c, fpi387.c, flashzpc.c, devtv.c, devmouse.c, devmpeg.c (which are Vita Nuova MIT-template).

The copyright is not necessarily Lucent's in all cases (eg, ether83815.c, sd53c8xx.c,
and much of the USB and wavelan support) because some things were written outside Lucent.
A more accurate summary will appear here shortly.
Meanwhile, if you'd like to use the software in some other program,
you can always ask us to work out the detailed appropriate copyright notice.
