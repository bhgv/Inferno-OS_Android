Booting Inferno on a Cerf cube

Build the /usr/inferno/os/cerf1110 kernel into /usr/inferno/os/cerf1110/icerf:
	mk
It uses common SA1110 code in ../sa1110, as well as ../port etc.

Make that icerf file available to the cerf cube by tftp.  How you do that depends on
your host system.

It should then be easy:

1. Reset the cerf cube (power off/on), and quickly, during `Waiting for RTC to stabilize'
	hit a key.

2. type
	tftp /usr/inferno/os/cerf1110/icerf c0008000
    with appropriate substitution for file name.

3. on success
	boot c0008000 0 0

it should run.
