.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tarfs
makes the contents of the directories and files archived in the given Unix/POSIX
.I tar
archive
.I tarfile
visible in the name space under
.IR mountpt .
They can then be accessed in an obvious way by other commands
such as
.IR ls (1)
and
.IR cp (1).
Only read access is supported.
User and group names are taken from the ``ustar'' headers when present.  Otherwise, the numeric user and group IDs are used.
The
.B -a
and
.B -b
options cause the
.IR tarfile 's
name space to be placed after or before the current contents of
.IR mountpt ;
the default is to replace that directory's contents.
Option
.B -p
causes permissions in the tar file to be discarded.
