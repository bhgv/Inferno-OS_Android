.TH INTRO 4
.SH NAME
intro \- introduction to file servers
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes programs that serve 9P
(see
.IR intro (5)),
and can therefore
be mounted, generating a new part of the name space.
Some, such as
.IR dossrv ,
thereby make the contents of a foreign file format visible directly
to Inferno applications;
others, such as
.IR acme ,
provide their own services through operations on files in a name space.
