.TH TRFS 4
.SH NAME
trfs \- translate spaces and other runes in names in a file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trfs
.I olddir
.I mountdir
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trfs
makes the contents of directory
.I olddir
appear on the directory
.IR mountdir ,
but every space character in file and directory names viewed through
.I mountdir
is made visible as a special `no-break space' character (U+00A0).
Other Inferno applications will not mistake it for the end of a file name,
and it has some visible representation in most fonts.
.SH SOURCE
.B /appl/cmd/trfs.b
.SH BUGS
There can be error or ambiguity if the existing tree also uses no-break space in its names.
