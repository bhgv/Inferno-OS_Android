.I archfile 
[
.I prefix ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Archfs
mounts at
.IR mountpoint
(default:
.BR /mnt/arch ),
a read-only file system representing the contents of 
.IR archfile ,
which is a file of the format produced by
.IR mkfs (8)
with the
.B -a
option.
Typically the archive file will have been created by 
.IR mkfs (8)
or
.IR create (8).
Any
.I prefix
names limit the file system's contents to files and directories in the
archive whose path names start with one of the prefixes.
.PP
The
.B -a
and
.B -b
options cause the archive contents to be mounted after or before the
mount point's existing contents, in a union dirctory (see
.IR bind (1)
for details).
Normally the archive contents replace the contents of
.IR mountpoint .
The
.B -s
option causes the rest of the archive to be skipped once a file is found in the archive which
does not start with any of the given prefixes. This is useful an archive is known to start
with a description of its contents (eg, the
.B /wrap
directory provided by
.IR create (8)),
and that is all that is needed under
.IR mountpoint .
