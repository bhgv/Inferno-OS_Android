.TH 9SRVFS 4 "Plan 9"
.SH NAME
9srvfs \- add Inferno service to Plan 9 service registry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 9srvfs
[
.BI -p " perm"
]
.I srvname
.I source
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I 9srvfs
is only usable (or indeed of interest) on Inferno hosted under Plan 9.
It uses
.IR srv9 (3)
to make an Inferno service
.I source
available to Plan 9 applications via the Plan 9 service registry.
.I Srv9 (3)
must previously have been bound to
.B /srv
in the current name space, with
.B -c
to allow file creation (see
.IR bind (1)).
.PP
.I Source
may be either a command or the name of a directory.
If
.I source
is surrounded by braces
.RB ( {
and
.BR } ),
it is invoked as a
.IR sh (1)
command, and its standard input (sic) is posted as Plan 9 service
.BI /srv/ srvname
with permissions
.I perm
(default: mode 600).
Otherwise,
.I source
is taken to be a directory that is the root of a name space to export to Plan 9,
an exporting file service is started (see
.IR sys-export (2)),
and again posted as Plan 9 service
.BI /srv/ srvname,
and the export terminates when the Plan 9 service file
has been removed and the last mounted instance goes away in Plan 9.
.SH EXAMPLE
Make the current Inferno environment variables available to Plan 9 applications:
.IP
.EX
bind -c '#â‚ª' /srv   # if not already done
9srvfs infenv /env
.EE
.PP
The name space can then be mounted in Plan 9,
allowing variables to be read and written in that Inferno environment:
.IP
.EX
mount -c /srv/infenv /n/ftp
ls /n/ftp
cat /n/ftp/emuargs
echo masked man >/n/ftp/zorro
.EE
.SH SOURCE
.B /appl/cmd/9srvfs.b
