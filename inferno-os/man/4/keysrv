.TH KEYSRV 4
.SH NAME
keysrv \- secret key server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auth/keysrv
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Keysrv
is a file service run on a connection to an authentication server.
It allows a remote user
to change a secret stored on the server by
.IR keyfs (4),
which must have been started before
.IR keysrv ,
in a name space with the authentication data available under
.BR /mnt/keys .
.PP
.I Keysrv
serves a single file,
.BR secret ,
on a connection accessed through file descriptor 0 (ie, the standard `input').
When invoked, it
first authenticates the connection using
.IR security-auth (2),
requiring the client to use
.B sha1
and
.BR rc4_256 .
If authentication succeeds,
.I keysrv
exports a name space containing a file
.BR secret .
The authentication ensures that only a user that possesses a valid certificate can connect to the service.
.PP
If the authenticated user (ie, the user name in the verified certificate)
has an entry in
.BR /mnt/keys ,
as served by
.IR keyfs (4),
and that user has a non-empty secret,
then the file
.B secret
will accept reads and writes.
(Otherwise, every read or write returns an appropriate error.)
Every successful read returns 0 bytes; thus a read can be used to check that the user is known and has a secret key.
Each write contains data of the following form:
.IP
.EX
.fi
.I oldhash
[
.I newsecret
]
.EE
.PP
.I Oldhash
is the SHA1 hash
(see
.IR keyring-sha1 (2))
of the user's existing secret, as 20 hexadecimal digits.
If the value of
.I oldhash
does not match that of the stored secret, the write returns an error and suitable diagnostic.
.I Oldhash
is optionally followed by a
.IR newsecret ,
in clear text as a sequence of bytes (typically the secret as
.IR utf (6)),
separated from
.I oldhash
by a single space.
If the
.I oldhash
matches that of the secret currently stored,
.I newsecret
replaces it.
The write returns an error if
.I oldhash
does not match the stored value, or if something else goes wrong.
.PP
.I Keysrv
can be invoked via
.IR listen (1):
.IP
.EX
listen -t -A 'tcp!*!infkey' {auth/keysrv}
.EE
.PP
Normally that is done automatically when
starting an authentication service using
.B svc/auth
(see
.IR svc (8)).
.PP
.IR Passwd (1)
dials the service, authenticates, and mounts the resulting connection on
.BR /mnt/keysrv ,
where it accesses the
.B secret
file to change the secret.
