.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cpu
dials
.I host
(using network
.B tcp
if
.I net
is not given), exports the local namespace and executes the given
.I command
on that machine. The local namespace is visible to the
command in
.BR /n/client ;
local device files are bound into the remote device directory.
If
.I command
is not given, then
.B /dis/sh
is run.
.PP
The
.B -C
option sets the algorithm
to be used following authentication for digesting or encryption, to
.IR alg .
See 
.IR ssl (3)
for the supported algorithms.
The default is
.BR none :
.IR ssl (3)
is not used after authentication.

.SH BUGS
Although the draw device files are visible
to the remote command, the original implementation
of Tk meant that windowing applications could not
receive events when
run remotely.
That has been fixed in this release, but
.I cpu
has not yet been updated to take advantage.
A later update will do that.
