.SH DESCRIPTION
These commands manage POSIX.1 tar archives in Inferno.
.PP
.I Gettar
reads a tar file from standard input and unpacks the contents into the current directory tree.
By default,
.I gettar
converts absolute path names, including names starting with
.LR  # ,
into names relative to the current directory; the
.B -R
option extracts such names as-is.
The
.B -k
option tells
.I gettar
to keep existing files rather than overwriting them with files from the archive.
The
.B -v
option causes
.I gettar
to print on standard error the names of files extracted.
Finally, listing one or more
.I names
as arguments will extract only those files.
.PP
.I Lstar
reads a tar file from standard input and lists the files contained therein,
one per line, with four space-separated fields giving the file name, modification time (in seconds since the epoch),
size (in bytes), and a constant 0 (the place holder for a checksum).
The format is the same as that produced by
.BR "du -n -t" .
.PP
.I Puttar
writes a tar file to standard output that contains each
.IR file ,
and its substructure if it is a directory.
Given no arguments,
.I puttar
instead reads a list of file names from standard input and includes
each file or directory named; it does not copy directory substructure.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following commands create a tar file with two files
.B test.b
and
.BR srv.b :
.IP
.EX
$ cat tarlist
test.b
srv.b
$ puttar <tarlist >test.tar
$ lstar <test.tar
test.b 867178082 1104 0
srv.b 866042662 3865 0
