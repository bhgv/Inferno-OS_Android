.TH STREAM 1
.SH NAME
stream \- stream data between source and sink
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stream
.RB [ \-a ]
.RB [ \-b
.IR bufsize ]
.I file1
[
.I file2
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Stream
creates a process that uses
.I stream
(see
.IR sys-read (2))
to stream data in chunks of at most
.I bufsize
bytes (default:
.LR Sys->ATOMICIO ,
or 8192 bytes) from
.I file1
to the standard output.
If
.I file2
is provided,
the two files are instead cross-connected by two streaming processes:
one process streams data from
.I file1
to
.IR file2 ,
and the other streams data from
.I file2
to
.IR file1 .
In all cases,
.I stream
writes data to the destination file in full buffers of
.I bufsize
bytes.
.PP
.I Stream
waits for all streaming processes to stop before returning,
unless the
.B -a
(asynchronous) option is given, which causes it to
return after spawning the streamers.
