.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ebook
provides a graphical browser for a set of files in Open eBook (OEB) version 1.0.1
format. It takes some care to try to ensure that memory usage does
not grow proportionally to the size of the book that is being viewed.
.I File
names either an OEB package file (conventional suffix
.BR .opf )
or an OEB document (conventional suffix
.B .html
or
.BR .xml ).
The
.B -m
option causes the window to be created in ``mini'' size
as suitable for display on a 240x320 pixel device.
.SS "GUI controls"
Controls at the top of the window enable the user to move
forward and backwards by pages through the document.
A ``Guide'' menu provides access to the guide as found in
the ebook package (if there is one). If the links in this are
followed, or if the reader follows links embedded within
the document, the up and down arrows enable moving
backwards and forwards in the ``link history''.
Arrows on the keyboard mimic the actions of the buttons
at the top of the window.
.PP
Clicking in the text allows an annotation to made on the
text; a text window is popped up and any text typed in
it will appear in a label attached to that text.
Annotations are stored in persistent storage and will
last from view to view of the document.
