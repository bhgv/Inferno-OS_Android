.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Connect
dials network address
.I netaddr
(default:
.BR "net!$collab!9999" ),
which should be served by an instance of
.IR collabsrv (8),
and mounts the resulting connection on
.BR /n/remote ;
it then binds
.BR /n/remote/collab
on
.I localdir
(default:
.BR /n/ftree/collab ).
.PP
The resulting hierarchy under
.B /n/remote
is determined by the site configuration, but usually includes the
directory
.BR /n/remote/services ,
which gives access to the server side of collaborative activities, as described in
.IR collabsrv (8),
and the directory
.BR /n/remote/collab ,
which contains the file hierarchy that contains all collaborative resources offered to a client device.
.PP
If an instance of
.IR wm-ftree (1)
is running in the same name space, then
after mounting the connection and adjusting the name space,
.IR connect
tells it that the name space has changed,
so any displayed view of it can be updated.
.PP
.I Connect
accepts the following options:
.TP
.BI -C " alg"
Specify the algorithm, 
.IR alg ,
to be used following authentication for digesting or encryption. See 
.IR ssl (3)
for the supported algorithms.
The default is
.BR none :
.IR ssl (3)
is not used after authentication.
.TP
.BI -k " kfile "
Specify the keyfile to be used when authenticating.
The default is
.BI /usr/ user /keyring/ netaddr ,
if that exists, and otherwise
.BI /usr/ user /keyring/default .
See 
.IR keyring-auth (2)
for more details.
.TP
.B -v
Causes
.I connect
to chat about its actions on standard output.
