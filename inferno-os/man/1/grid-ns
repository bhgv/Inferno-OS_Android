.TH GRID-NS 1
.SH NAME
grid: ns \- exports a selected namespace and serves it on
standard input
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "grid/srv/ns	[ -r " "relpath " "]" " path1 path2...path n"
.br
.BI "grid/runns	[ -r " "relpath " "]" " path1 path2...path n"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ns
exports a selected subsection of the local namespace and serves it on 
.I stdin.
The path arguments specify which directories are to be exported. If subdirectories are exported without their parents, 
.I ns
attempts to maintain the namespace structure by creating the parents but populating them only with the selected subdirectories. For example, exporting 
.B /appl/lib
would mean that the exported 
.B /appl
directory contained nothing apart from the
.B lib
subdirectory. If
.I relpath
is specified, all paths will be viewed relative to this path. For instance, if
.I relpath
is
.BR /usr/inferno ,
then
.B /usr/inferno/bin/dis
would be listed as
.B /bin/dis
and
.B /tmp
would not be listed at all.
.PP
.IR Grid-register (1)
may be used in conjunction with 
.I ns
to register it with a 
.IR registry (4)
and to export and serve its namespace across
.IR dial (2) 
network connections. Incoming connections may also be displayed visually using
.IR grid-monitor (1).
For example:
.PP
.BI "grid/register [" " options ..." " ] { grid/srv/ns " "paths..." " } | grid/srv/monitor 1 'NS resource'
.PP
This set of commands is encapsulated within the shell script
.I runns
which will automatically register 
.I ns
with a
.IR registry (4)
if possible and start up the graphical display to show connections to the resource. There is no need for the user to execute
.I ns
outside of
.I runns
unless the namespace it provides is required to be accessible in a different way to that provided by
.IR grid-register (1).
