.B sendmail
[
.I recipient ...
]

.B Sendmail
sends mail to each
.I recipient
named as an argument. It reads its standard input to
get the text of the message.

is named, the recipient(s) will be taken from the message header.

The mail message is scanned for lines beginning
.RL ` From: ',
.RL ` To: '
and
.RL ` Cc: '.

line is found, the sender is assumed to be the current user. The recipient(s) of the message
can be mentioned as arguments or in a list of names in a
.RL ` To: '
line but not as both. 
If the sender's name is unqualified (is just a user name),
.I sendmail
appends the value of the environment variable
.LR DOMAIN .
.PP
.B Sendmail
delivers the mail using the module
.IR smtp (2),
which
connects to a mail server running the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP),
using the symbolic host name
.B $MAILSERVER
(see
