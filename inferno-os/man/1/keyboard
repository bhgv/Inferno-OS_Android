.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Wm/keyboard
provides a soft keyboard for touch-screen devices.
Characters selected on the on-screen keyboard using a stylus (or mouse button 1) are passed to Tk via
.B Tk->keyboard
in
.IR tk (2).
The
.B -t
option causes it to put itself on the
.IR wm (1)
task bar from the start.
The
.B -e
option causes it to treat the `exit' button on the title bar as
a request to put itself back on the task bar.
.PP
.B Wm/pen
provides character input using single-stroke gestures with the stylus
(or mouse button 1).
The
.B -r
option allows the pen window to be reshaped.
Options are otherwise the same as for
