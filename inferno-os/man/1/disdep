.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Disdep
reads each
.IR file ,
which must be a Dis object file,
and finds all unique strings in it that end in
.BR .dis .
It takes each such string as the name of a Dis file, and
if the file exists, it does the same for it, and so on, recursively.
It writes each unique name to the standard output.
The result is a list of all statically-named Dis files that might be referenced by
an application, typically as the operand of a Limbo
.B load
operator.
Several options change or extend the output:
.TP
.B -a
Print all names as they are encountered in the search, including duplicates.
.TP
.B -d
Indent to show the dependency structure.
.TP
.B -o
Show only the immediate (outermost) dependencies of each
.IR file .
.TP
.B -p
Print the dependency relation as pairs:
a file, a space, and the name of a file on which it depends.
Only the the first name is printed when a file depends on no other.
This format is useful as input to
.IR mk (10.1)
dependency generators, or dependency graphing programs.
.TP
.B -s
Include strings of the form
.B
\&"$[A-Z].*"
on the assumption
they are the names of system modules loaded by the application.
