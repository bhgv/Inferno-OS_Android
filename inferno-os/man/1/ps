.TH PS 1
.SH NAME
ps \- process (thread) status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bind '#p' /prog
.PP
.B ps
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ps
prints to the standard output information about all current Inferno processes.
It looks in
.B /prog
for process status files;
normally that requires that the
.IR prog (3)
device has previously been bound there (as shown above),
but it is also possible to import
.B /prog
from a remote machine.
.PP
Each line of information printed consists of seven columns:
the process id, the process group id, the owner of the
process, cpu time used by the process, the run state of the process, the amount of memory used
by the process, and the name of the module containing the
currently running function.

and

in
.IR wm-misc (1),

.SH BUGS
The amount reported as ``memory used'' does not accurately
reflect the amount of memory referred to by the process,
because the heap is shared.
.br
The cpu time used is currently shown as zero in most hosted implementations.
