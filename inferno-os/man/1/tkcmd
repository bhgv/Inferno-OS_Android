.TH TKCMD 1
.SH NAME
tkcmd \- enter Tk commands interactively
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tkcmd
[
.B -iu
] [
.I tkarg
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Tkcmd
allows interactive entry of Tk commands; it is useful for
testing out features of Tk prior to incorporating them in
a Limbo program. It accepts two arguments:
.TP
.B -i
Force interactive mode. In interactive mode (the default if the
standard input is directed at
.BR /dev/cons ),
a prompt is printed before every tk command entered.
.TP
.B -u
Suppress the automatic tk update command after
every entered command.
.PP
When
.I tkcmd
is started, a new top level window is created;
.I tkcmd
creates a titlebar and handles all the normal
window window manager interactions.
When the window is closed,
.I tkcmd
terminates.
Each line typed to
.I tkcmd
is passed directly to the function
.B Tk->cmd
(see
.IR tk (2))
and executed in the context of the top level window;
a Tk ``update'' command is then issued.
Any return value from the command is printed.
There is one predefined Tk channel,
named ``stdout''; anything sent down this channel will
be printed to the standard output.
