.SH DESCRIPTION
Currently there is just one Inferno application to support Atmel AVRs
but others should appear.
.PP
.I Burn
initialises or verifies the contents of an Atmel ATmega128 AVR.
The programming board must be connected to a serial port (see
.IR eia (3)),
.B /dev/eia0
by default.
.I File.srec
is a file containing the desired flash contents in Motorola S-record format,
as produced by
.IR ms2 (10.1).
By default,
.I burn
erases the AVR chip (both flash and EEPROM), then loads the flash with the contents of
.IR file.srec .
The
.B -e
option stops
.I burn
from erasing first, allowing additional code or data to be loaded (but only into an already-erased region).
If the
.B -r
option is given,
.I burn
instead compares the contents of the AVR with the data in
.IR file.srec .
.I Burn
supports the MIB510 programming board from Crossbow Technology Inc.
