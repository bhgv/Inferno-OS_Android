.TH TSORT 1
.SH NAME
tsort \- topological sort
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tsort
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tsort
reads a set of partial order relations between labels (sequences of non-space characters)
from its standard input,
and lists the labels on its standard output one per line following a topological sort.
Each input line represents a set of inequalities: the first label on the line is less than
all the others on the same line, and should appear earlier
in sorted order.
(The relation might for instance represent arcs in a directed graph, from
the first label on a line to the others, or dependency relationships.)
Labels on a line are separated by space or tab.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the input contains cycles,
.I tsort
prints a diagnostic on standard error for each cycle, listing its members.
The members of each cycle will also appear on the standard output, in any order,
but after any predecessors outside the cycle.
