.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wish
provides a Tcl
command line interface to the Limbo/Tk graphics toolkit.
The input should be in the format of Tcl or Tk commands
(see
.IR intro (9)).
There are two variants.
.PP
Plain
.B wish
must be run from the Inferno console instead of
.IR mux (1)
or
.IR wm (1).
It takes input from each
.I file
in turn, then prompts for further commands from the standard input.
Its commands operate on a Tk toplevel covering the whole screen.
.PP
.BR Wm/wish
runs instead in a shell window under
.IR wm (1).
It reads initial input from the optional
.IR file ,
then prompts for further commands on its standard input unless
the
.B -k
option is given.
Its commands operate on the Tk toplevel of a new window
created by
.B Wmlib->titlebar
(see
.IR wmlib (2)),
initially titled
.BR WishPad .
.PP
The following special input sequences are recognised:
.TP
.B \en
newline
.TP
.B \et
tab
.TP
.B \eb
backspace
.TP
.B \e\e
backslash

.SH BUGS
Arguably this has been superseded by
.IR sh-tk (1)
for scripting Tk applications,
and
.IR tkcmd (1)
for development and testing of Tk configurations for use by Limbo programs.
