.TH MUX 1
.SH NAME
mux \- interactive television demo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mux/mux
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mux
is a standalone application environment run from the Inferno console
in
.IR emu (1)
or started
automatically by
.IR init (8)
in a native environment.
It directly uses the
.IR draw (3)
device and either keyboard or Infrared,
and cannot be run under
.IR wm (1).
It is included in this release only as an example of the use of the Prefab graphics
module described by
.IR prefab-intro (2).
The simpler style of graphics and interaction provided by Prefab and
demonstrated by
.I mux
might be more appropriate than Tk
on devices that use infrared remote control
for interaction, such as televisions,
or devices with limited screen space, such as pocket devices or portable telephones.
.SS Configuration
.I Mux
produces a menu derived from the configuration file
.BR /services/basic .
Each line in the file has three fields, separated by
.BR : ,
of the following form:
.IP
.IB icon : app : label
.PP
The
.I icon
is the name of a bitmap file to displayed in the menu alongside the textual
.I label
(which is the rest of the line).
When the item is selected, as described below,
.I mux
runs the Dis file
.IP
.BI /dis/mux/ app .dis
