.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ls
lists the named
.IR file s
in an order and format determined by its options.
The options determining the output format are:
.TP 10
.B -l
Produce output in long format. The information given in
each column is as follows:
.RS
.IP 1.
The permission mode of the file. This is formatted as 11 characters;
the first is
.RB ` d '
if the file is a directory,
.RB ` a '
if the file is append-only,
.RB ` A '
if it is an authentication file,
or
.RB ` - '
otherwise.
The next character is
.RB ` l '
if the file is exclusive-use,
or
.RB ` - '
otherwise.
The remaining characters are in three groups
of three, each representing one permission bit. Each character
is either
.RB ` r '
(read permission),
.RB ` w '
(write permission),
.RB ` x '
(execute permission)
or 
.RB ` - '
(no permission).
The three groups represent permissions granted for that file
to the file's owner, members of the file's group and anybody else
respectively.
.IP 2.
The device type (this is the `#' device letter for local devices
or `M' for files mounted over a 9P connection).
.IP 3.
The device instance number (this distinguishes between
separately mounted instances of the same device).
.IP 4.
The file's owner.
.IP 5.
The file's group.
.IP 7.
The size of the file in bytes.
.IP 8.
The date and time the file was last modified (see also the
.B -u
and the
.B -e
options).
.IP 9.
The name of the file.
.RE
.TP
.B -m
Print the name of the user who most recently modified
the file.
.TP
.B -q
Print the file's
.I qid
(see
.IR sys-stat (2))
at the beginning of each line;
the printed fields are in the order
path, version, and type.
.TP
.B -u
Applicable only to the
.B -l
and
.B -t
options: causes time-sorted listings to be listed by
time of last access, and the access time to be printed
in long-format listings instead of the modification time.
.TP
.B -e
Applicable only to the
.B -l
and
.B -u
options: causes the time to be displayed as seconds since the epoch.
.TP
.B -p
Print each filename as a bare name, without the name
of the containing directory.
.PP
The other options relate to the order in which the listed files
are printed, and which files are selected. Usually, each
.I file
that is a directory has its contents printed. The
.B -d
option causes the directory itself to be listed.
In a union directory, it is possible for there to be
two or more instances of a file with the same name.
The
.B -c
option causes only the first one occurring to be
listed. The options relating to ordering are:
.TP 10
.B -n
Do not sort the files at all.
.TP
.B -t
Sort by modification time (most recent first)
or access time if the
.B -u
option is also specified.
.TP
.B -s
Sort by size (smallest first).
.TP
.B -r
Reverse the sort order.
.TP
.B  -F
Add the character
.B /
after all directory names
and the character
.B *
after all executable files.
.TP
.B -T
Print the character
.B t
before each file if it has the temporary flag set, and
.B -
otherwise.
.PP
.I Lc
is the same as
.IR ls ,
but sets the
.B -p
option and pipes the output through
.IR mc (1).
