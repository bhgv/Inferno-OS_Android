.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tail
copies the named file to the standard output beginning
at a designated place.
If no file is named, the standard input is copied.
.PP
Copying begins at position
.BI + number
measured from the beginning, or
.BI - number
from the end of the input.
.I Number
is counted in lines, 1K blocks or characters,
according to the appended flag
.LR l ,
.LR b ,
or
.LR c .
Default is
.B -10l
(ten ell).
.PP
The further flag
.L r
causes tail to print lines from the end of the file in reverse order;
.L f
(follow) causes
.I tail,
after printing to the end, to keep watch and
print further data as it appears.
.PP
The second syntax is that promulgated by POSIX, where the
numbers of lines (-n) or characters (-c) are specified separately as signed
integers. Note than an unsigned value is treated as negative,
ie '-n 2' is equivalent to '-n -2'.
