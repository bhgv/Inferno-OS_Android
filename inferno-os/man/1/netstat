.SH NAME
netstat \- summarize network connections
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B netstat
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Netstat
prints information about network connections.
The following is presented for each connection:
.IP
connection name: the protocol and conversation directory in
.B /net
(eg.
.BR tcp/8 )
.br
user name
.br
status of the connection
.br
address of each end of the connection (eg host and port if IP)
.PP
The information is obtained from the
.B status
file of each entry under the network directories
.BR /net/tcp ,
.BR /net/udp
and
.BR /net/il .
.PP
.I Netstat
relies on a populated

have previously been bound there.
