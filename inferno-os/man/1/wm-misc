.SH DESCRIPTION
A collection of simple applications and utilities that operate under the
Wm window manager.
Other Wm applications exist, see their respective manual pages for
more information.
.PP
.TP
.B wm/about
Display system version and copyright information.
.TP
.B wm/clock
Display an analogue clock.
.TP
.B wm/coffee
A whimsical plaything.
.TP
.B wm/colors
Displays the Inferno palette.
Clicking on a particular colour displays its RGB values.
.TP
.B wm/date
Displays the current date and time in a window.
.TP
.B wm/edit
A simple cut-and-paste text editor.
Several menus provide the usual editing commands.
Text selections are dragged out using mouse button 1.
Mouse button-2 displays a pop-up menu of the Cut, Copy and Paste commands.
.TP
.B wm/mand
A fractal browser to explore the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
Button 1 drags a rectangle to zoom into, button 2 shows the  Julia set at the chosen point, button 3 zooms out.
To produce more accurate pictures, the iteration depth may be increased by altering 
the depth scale factor. The default number of iterations per point is 253. The sets are
plotted by filling regions of (apparently) the same colour. Deselecting the fill option
will plot the points in the usual fashion.
.TP
.B wm/memory
Displays memory usage.
Three usage bars are displayed, one for each of the Inferno memory
pools: main, heap and image. The current usage (in bytes) is displayed
to the left of each bar, and the number of blocks in use appears in red.
The maximum permitted size of each pool is given (in megabytes) to the right of its
usage bar.
Each bar also sports a highwater mark.
The usage data is re-read and displayed once every second.
.TP
.B wm/polyhedra
A program to display convex regular polyhedra. The menu options allow the user
to alter the speed of rotation and the axis of rotation. To display a different
solid, move forward or back with the prev and next boxes. Selecting the dual
box will show the dual of a solid rather than the original solid. Finally the 
edges, clear and faces boxes determine whether edges are shown, whether the
screen is cleared before the next plot and whether faces are shown respectively.
.TP
.B wm/reversi
An implementation of the popular game. The default set up is for black to be the
machine and white the human player. Use the Black and White menu options to
change this. The level of any machine player may be set using the Black level
and White level boxes. This determines the amount of lookahead performed
by the tree search algorithm.
.TP
.B wm/rt
A Dis module inspector: it can show the Dis instructions, strings,
types and other attributes of a module; it also allows the user
to set some attributes stored in a module's header.
.TP
.B wm/stopwatch
A simple-minded stopwatch.
Only useful for coarse-grained timings.
.TP
.B wm/sweeper
Mine sweeping game.
.TP
.B wm/task
Task manager: it lists the processes running when it starts,
and offers buttons to kill a selected process, kill its process group,
show its open files, or debug it using
.IR deb (1).
A process is selected from the list using mouse button 1.
.I Task
does not automatically refresh the list; there is a
.B Refresh
button to prompt it to do so.
.TP
.B wm/tetris
The ubiquitous and annoyingly addictive tile dropping game.
The game keys are:
.RB ` 7 '
move left;
.RB ` 8 '
rotate (anti-clockwise);
.RB ` 9 '
move right;
.RB ` p '
pause;
.RI ` space '
drop and
.RB ` q '
quit.
A mouse or stylus can also be used to guide the pieces (eg, by tapping the screen in the desired direction).
Scores are stored in the file
.BR /lib/scores/tetris .
Score file updates are not interlocked \- it's only a game!
.TP
.B wm/unibrowse
A handy utility for browsing the unicode character set, finding out what
particular characters look like in different fonts, finding out exactly which
characters a font provides, and finding the name of a character
that you have managed to grab into the snarf buffer.
.TP
.B wm/view
Image viewer.
Displays GIF, Inferno
.IR image (6),
JPEG,
PNG
and X bitmap image files.
The viewer creates a new window to display the contents of each
.IR file .
If no arguments are given, the file browser panel
.IR filename (1)
is displayed to prompt the user to select an image file to view.
If the
.B -i
option is given,
.I view
continues to listen for requests from the
.IR plumber (8);
the
.B -i
option will normally appear only in rules in
.IR plumbing (6)
files.
.TP
.B wm/winctl
Window management tool.
Displays a set of buttons that provide for:
raising a window to the top or lowering it to the bottom of the
screen window stack; moving a window to a new position; iconising a window;
deleting a window.
.IP
Click on the button for the required action then click on the window to apply it to.
When moving a window, click and drag the target.
Deleting a window is error-prone. Currently using this tool on a charon or acme
window has strange effects.
