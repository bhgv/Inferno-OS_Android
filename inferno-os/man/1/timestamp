.TH TIMESTAMP 1
.SH NAME
timestamp \- log event times
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timestamp
[
.I tag
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Timestamp
reads lines from its standard input and writes them to its
standard output, prefixing each line with the time that
it was written, in decimal milliseconds since
.I timestamp
was started. If
.I tag
is given, it is written along with the time stamp on each line,
to enable tagging if several writers are each writing
to the same log file.
.PP
The first line written gives the time that
.I timestamp
was started, in milliseconds since the epoch.
Note that logging events can cause timings to change,
and that the timestamps are only as accurate as the
times reported by
.BR /dev/time .
