.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wm/brutus
[
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Brutus
is a multi-file editor for UTF format text files.
.PP
When editing multiple files, each file appears in its own window.
Button 1 can be used to make a window current. Within the current
window, button 1 selects text.
Double clicking selects text up to the boundaries of words, lines,
quoted text or bracketed text depending upon the text at the point of the
double click. Double clicking at the start of a line
selects the entire line. Double clicking just inside various forms of
brace selects text up to the matching brace, correctly handling nested braces.
Button 2 displays a menu of editing commands:
.TF snarf
.TP
.B cut
Delete the selected text and save it in the snarf buffer.
.TP
.B paste
Replace the selected text by the contents of the snarf buffer.
.TP
.B snarf
Save the selected text in the snarf buffer.
.TP
.B look
Search forwards and select the next occurrence of the selected text.
.PD
.PP
Mouse chording is implemented, as in
.IR acme (1).
Dragging a selection with button-1 held down and then also clicking
button-2 cuts the selected text into the Snarf buffer.
Clicking button-3 instead of button-2 replaces the selected text with the contents
of the Snarf buffer.
.PP
Clicking button 3 extracts the whitespace-bounded string around the point of the
click and plumbs it to the appropriate application (see
.IR plumber (8)).

are recognised and used to control the visual appearance
of text. The
.I font
may be one of:
.BR Roman ,
.BR Italic , 
.BR Bold ,
and
.B Type
giving normal, italicised, emboldened, and constant width text.
