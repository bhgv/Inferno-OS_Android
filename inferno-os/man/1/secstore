.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Secstore
manages files on the eponymous Plan 9 secure storage service.
It holds a set of files for each of its users.
The service is most often used to store a file
.B factotum
containing user credentials in a form ready to be loaded into
.IR factotum (4).
.I Op
is one of the following operations:
.TP
.B d
Delete the given files on the server.
.TP
.B p
Print the contents of each file on standard output.
Each line is written separately, so that files of keys will be received correctly when written to
.IR factotum (4).
.TP
.B r
Replace the contents of files on the server by the contents of the named files,
after encrypting them.
In each case, the file name on the server is the last component of the local file name
(ie, everything after the final
.RB ` / ').
.TP
.B t
List a table of contents of
.IR user 's
collection on the the server.
By default, only the names are listed, one per line, but
given the
.B -v
option, each line displays name, file size in bytes, date last stored, and SHA-1 hash of the file's contents.
.TP
.B x
Extract the named files into files of the same name in the current directory.
By default, they are decrypted (ie, in clear text).
.PP
If no
.I op
is specified,
.I secstore
connects to the server (thus checking the connection and the validity
of both
.I key
and
.IR user ),
but does nothing with it.
.PP
By default,
.I secstore
prompts for a secret key to authenticate the user and the
.B secstore
service.
The service might be configured to demand an extra authentication code, such as a `pin', in which case
.I secstore
will then prompt for that as well.
The options are:
.TP
.B -i
Read one or two lines from the standard input:
the first line contains the secret; the optional second line contains the extra authentication code.
.TP
.BI -k " key"
Use
.I key
as the secret to authenticate with the
.B secstore
service.
.TP
.BI -p " pin"
Supply
.I pin
as the extra authentication code if the server demands it.
.TP
.BI -s " address"
Connect to the server at the given network
.IR address ,
as defined by
.IR dial (2),
and translated by
.IR cs (8).
The default is
.BR net!$auth!secstore .
.TP
.BI -u " user"
Authenticate as
.I user
(default: the Inferno user name contained in
.BR /dev/user )
.TP
.B -v
Make the output more verbose:
display the name announced by the remote server; and use the long form of the table of contents.
.SH EXAMPLE
Retrieve the
.B factotum
file and feed the keys therein to
.IR factotum (4):
.IP
.EX
auth/secstore p factotum >/mnt/factotum/ctl
.EE
.SH SOURCE
.B /appl/cmd/auth/secstore.b

.SH BUGS
Perhaps
.I secstore
should allow several
.B -s
options as a simple way to replicate the same files on different servers.
