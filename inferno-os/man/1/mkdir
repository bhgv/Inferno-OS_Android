.TH MKDIR 1
.SH NAME
mkdir \- make a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkdir
[
.B -p
]
[
.I dirname ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mkdir
creates the specified directories. It requires write permission in the parent directory.
.PP
The
.B -p
option causes
.I mkdir
to create the whole path
.IR dirname ,
including any missing parent directories; it also will not
complain if
.I dirname
already exists and is a directory.
.PP
The new directories are created with permissions starting with
.B 8r777
but masked with the permissions of the parent directory according to the
procedure followed by
.IR sys-open (2).
For example, if the parent directory lacks write permission for group
and has no permissions for others,
so will the newly created directory.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If any directory cannot be created successfully,
.I mkdir
prints a warning, and continues with any remaining directories,
but returns

\&"error"
exit status at the end.
