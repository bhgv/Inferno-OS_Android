.SH NAME
grid: query \- graphical interface to view resources registered with a known
.IR registry (4)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grid/query
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Query
displays the resources currently registered with a given
.IR registry (4)
and allows the user to mount and browse through the namespaces they provide. 
.PP
Resource categories are displayed in the main window, opening any of these (by clicking on the '+' next to the name) will reveal the names of the individual resources within that category. Each resource has a set of attributes which may be viewed at the lowest level of the displayed tree. Clicking on a specific resource and clicking the
.B Mount
button that appears will mount that resource (if possible) and display the imported namespace in a new window. From this window, the user can then browse this namespace as well as opening and running files. A shell window may also be opened to allow more complicated tasks to be performed.
.PP
Clicking
.B Search
brings up a search window. Here, the current
.IR registry (4)
may be searched for a resource containing the specified attribute names and values.
.B Refresh
updates the list of resources in the main window in case any have been added or removed.

.SH BUGS
Currently, searching for a resource on a
.IR registry (4)
is only implemented in a very simple way. Given the attribute 
.I (name, value)
pairs, the search will return all resources whose attributes exactly match the specified values.
.B *
may be used to match any attribute value but not name.
