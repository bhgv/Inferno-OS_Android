.TH NS 1
.SH NAME
ns \- display current namespace
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ns
[
.B -r
] [
.I pid
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ns
displays the construction of the namespace of the given
.IR pid ,
or its own (as inherited) by default.
Based on the contents of
.BI /prog/ pid /ns ,
it prints on standard output a sequence of bind and mount commands
(see
.IR bind (1))
that might reconstruct the same name space if executed.
In practice, mounts of services such as
.IR ftpfs (4)
often refer to the names of pipe ends that are now inaccessible.
Furthermore, if any file involved has been renamed since the
mount or bind, the original name of the file is shown.
.PP
Mounts of file services on a network show the network address as
given to
.IR dial (2)
instead of the name of the data file for the connection; the
.B -r
option causes
.I ns
to show the raw file name instead.
