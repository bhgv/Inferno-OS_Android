.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tk
is a loadable builtin for
.IR mash.
It provides a set of primitives for customizing a
.I mash
window and building fairly sophisticated graphical functions. It is currently implemented as a single command with a variety of subcommands. For the
.I tk
command to work,
.I mash
must have been started using
.BR wm/wmmash .
In the following descriptions, references to return values indicate strings put on a command's standard output.
.SS Creating a Menu Bar
The
.B def
subcommand is used to define graphical pushbuttons and menus. The
.B def button
and
.B def ibutton
commands are used to define pushbuttons labelled with text or graphical icons, respectively.
The
.I name
parameter is used to label buttons, and to layout both buttons and ibuttons.
.I Value
is a command to be executed when the button is clicked, and must be quoted if it contains white space.
.I Image
is the name of a bitmap file; it is looked for in
.BR /icon/tk ,
unless the name begins with
.BR@ ,
which suppresses prepending
.BR /icon/tk .
.br
.B Def menu
is used to name and label menu buttons, and
.B def item
specifies items within the corresponding pulldown menus. In
.BR "def item" ,
.I menu
is a name supplied on a
.B def menu
subcommand,
.I name
is the label for this menu item, and
.I value
is a command to execute when this menu item is selected.
All the items in a menu are simple command buttons;
there is no provision for any other kind of control, or for cascading menus.
.br
The
.B layout
subcommand creates and makes visible a menu bar, using menus and buttons defined with
.B def
subcommands. The current components, if any, are removed first,
so layout with no parameters just removes all the current buttons and menus from the
.I mash
window. The components are laid out from left to right, in the order presented in the
.B layout
subcommand. A copy of the current
.I mash
environment is made, and commands executed as a result of clicking buttons
or selecting menu items are executed in that environment.
For example, variables will have the values they had when the layout was done.
.br
The
.B env
subcommand can be used to make a new copy of the environment for use by button
or menu actions.
.SS Displaying Popup Widgets
The
.B notice
subcommand pops up a window containing
.I message
and a single button to dismiss the window. The icon displayed in the window is
.BR /icons/tk/error .
No value is returned by
.BR notice .
.br
The
.B dialog
subcommand is more complex;
.I title
is used to name the window, and multiple buttons labelled according to the
.B label
parameter(s) are provided.
.I Default
is the number of the button which is the default choice. The leftmost button is numbered 0.
When the user selects one of the buttons, the dialog box is popped down and the
number of the button selected is returned.
.br
The
.B file
subcommand pops up a standard Inferno file selection box.
.I Dir
specifies the initial directory to display, and pattern specifies which non-directory files to include in the list of files. If the Cancel button in the file dialog is clicked, no value is returned. If a file is selected and the Exit button is clicked, the full pathname of the file is returned, complete with final
.B /
if the file is a directory. Double clicking on a non-directory file in the list will likewise return that file's path. Double clicking on a directory in the list will display the contents of that directory.
.br
The
.B string
subcommand pops up a small window with
.I mesg
as the label of a text field. Characters typed into the text field, up to but not including ENTER, are returned.
.SS Dealing With the Selection
.br
The
.B sel
subcommand returns whatever is currently selected. When typing into the shell's window, nothing is selected, so nothing is returned. However, if invoked via a pushbutton and there is a selection, it is returned.
.br
The
.B sput
subcommand puts
.I string
into the snarf buffer maintained by the window manager, and the
.B sget
subcommand retrieves and returns the current contents of the snarf buffer. This provides a way to pass text between the shell and other applications. The Snarf and Paste buttons on the popup menu associated with mouse button two can also be used to do this.

.SS Miscellaneous Tk Subcommands
The
.B taskbar
subcommand lets you put
.I string
in the title bar of the
.I mash
window. The old value is returned.
.br
The
.B text
subcommand returns the contents of the
.I mash
window.
.br
The
.B clear
subcommand removes all text from the window.
.br
The
.B dump
subcommand returns the
.I mash-tk
commands needed to define the buttons and menus currently defined,
and to recreate the currently visible set of buttons and menus, or, if
.B dump
has parameters, the commands needed to define the buttons and menus named by the parameters.
.br
The
.B geom
subcommand returns the position of the upper left corner of the
.I mash
window relative to the upper left corner of the Inferno screen.
