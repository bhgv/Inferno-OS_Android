.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chgrp
[

.I file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Chgrp
changes the group ownership of each
.I file
to the given
.IR id ,
if the file's server
permits it.
The
.B -u
and
.B -o

and cause
.I chgrp
to change file ownership instead,
if the file's server permits it.
.PP
Normally, a file's group can be changed by the file's owner, if the
owner is a member of the new group, or by the leader of both
the file's current group and the new group,
but various underlying devices, file servers and host operating systems
might not permit the operation at all.
Group and ownership changes allowed by a given device are documented by
the device's manual page.
See
.IR sys-stat (2)
for the variations amongst host operating systems.
