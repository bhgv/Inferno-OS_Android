.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wm/ftree

.B -d

.I root
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ftree
displays the given
.I root
directory
(default:
.BR / )
in a graphical form as a tree.
Files and subdirectories are listed
beneath the directory that contains them.
Initially, the contents of a subdirectory are not displayed, but selecting the
.B ⊕
symbol next to its name with button 1 causes its contents to be displayed there, and
the
.B ⊕
symbol changes to
.BR ⊖ ;
clicking that collapses the subdirectory display back to its name.
(If the directory is empty, the circle will be empty.)
Selecting a file or directory name with button 1 pops up a menu of
operations:
.BR Open ,
.BR Copy ,
.BR "Paste into" ,
and
.BR Remove .
.B Open
plumbs the full path name of the file or directory; it is up to the
.IR plumber (8)
to act appropriately based on the structure of the file name,
as controlled by the user's
.IR plumbing (6)
file.
Typically images will be displayed in a separate window, source files will be opened in an editor,
and so on.
Directory structure can be copied by invoking
.B Copy
on the source, then
.B "Paste into"
on the destination directory.
The
.B -d
option disallows all operations except
.BR Open .
.PP
Normally,
.I ftree
displays the usual
.IR wm (1)
controls, and interprets them as usual.
The other options change that behaviour:
.TP
.B -e
Ignore `exit' but offer move or resize.
.TP
.B -E
Ignore exit, and do not offer move or resize.
.TP
.B -p
Do exit, but do not offer move or resize.
.PP
The different options are used to program a user interface for handheld touch screen devices.
For instance, a start panel can be created by invoking
.I ftree
with the
.B -E
option, ensuring that the
.I ftree
screen is always there, and all subsequent interaction can be controlled
by the construction of the
.I root
namespace and suitable choice of plumbing rules.
