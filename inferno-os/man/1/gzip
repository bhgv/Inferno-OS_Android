.SH NAME
gzip, gunzip \- compression and decompression utilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gzip
[
.B \-v
] [
.BI \- level
] [
.IR file ...
]
.br
.B gunzip
[
.IR file ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Gzip
and
.B gunzip
perform data compression and decompression
compatible with the Unix
.I gzip
file format,
which uses a hybrid Lempel-Ziv 1977 and Huffman compression algorithm
called `deflate'.
If no arguments are given
.B gzip
compresses each
.I file
replacing it by a file of the same
name with the a
.B .gz
suffix appended.
If no files are given, standard input
and standard output are used.
.I Level
is a single decimal digit between 1 and 9;
higher numbers give better compression.
The default
.I level
is 6.
The
.B \-v
option causes
.B gzip
to report the compression ratio of each file that
it compresses.
.PP
.B Gunzip
performs the opposite operation to
.BR gzip ;
each
.I file
(which must have a
.B .gz
suffix) is uncompressed, and replaced
by a file of the same name with the
.B .gz
suffix removed. If no files are given,
standard input and standard output are used.
