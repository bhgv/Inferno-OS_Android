.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Snarf
serves a single file,
.BR snarf .
Reading the file returns the current
contents of the host window system's own clipboard (equivalent to
the Inferno window system's `snarf buffer').
If the file is opened for writing, subsequent writes append to an internal buffer;
when the file is closed, that buffer's contents are written to the host window system's clipboard.
.PP
.IR Emu (1)
automatically binds the device to both
.B /dev
and
.B /chan
when it starts up, if a window system is configured.
