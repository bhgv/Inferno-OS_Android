.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I dup
device serves a one-level directory containing files whose
names are decimal numbers.
Each such file also has an associated control file.
A file of name
.I n
corresponds to open file descriptor
.I n
in the current process.
.PP
A
.IR sys-open (2)
of file
.I n
results in a file descriptor identical to
what would be returned from a system call
.BI sys->dup( n,
.BR -1) .
Note that the result is no longer a file in the
.I dup
device.
.PP
The
.I stat
operation returns information about the device file, not the open file it points to.
A stat of
.BI #d/ n
will contain
.I n
for the name, 0 for the length, and 400, 200, or 600 (octal)
for the mode, depending on whether the dup target is open
for reading, writing, or both.
.PP
A file of name
.IB n ctl
may be read to discover the properties of the associated file descriptor, in format identical to that of the
.B fd
file in
.IR prog (3).
