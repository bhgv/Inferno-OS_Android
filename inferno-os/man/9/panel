.SH NAME
panel \- embedded graphics
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f5panel\fI \fIpathName \fR?\fIoptions\fR?
.SH STANDARD OPTIONS
.EX
-anchor       -borderwidth  -background   -relief
.EE
.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.TP
.B -height \fIdist\fP
Specifies a desired height for the panel.
If this option isn't specified, the panel's desired height is computed
from the image and mask images. If these are replicated,
the default is zero.
.TP
.B -width \fIdist\fP
Specifies a desired width for the panel.
If this option isn't specified, the panel's desired height is computed
from the image and mask images. If these are replicated,
the default is zero.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f5panel\fR command creates a new window (given by the \fIpathName\fR
argument) and makes it into a panel widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line
to configure aspects of the panel such as its background colour and 3-D relief.
The \f5panel\fR command returns its
\fIpathName\fR argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named \fIpathName\fR.
.PP
A panel is a widget that displays arbitrary graphics drawn outside
of Tk. An application is free to use any image or mask that it
chooses to create; the panel will display the contents of the image
through the mask (see
.IR draw (2)).
.PP
A panel widget will not display anything until its image has been
set using
.B putimage
(see
.IR tk (2)).

.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
The \f5panel\fR command creates a new Tk command whose name
is \fIpathName\fR. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget: It has the following general form:
.RS
.EX
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.EE
.RE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behaviour of the command.  The following
commands are possible for panel widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \f5cget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5panel\fR
function.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5configure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list of all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR.  If
one or more \fIoption-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5panel\fR
function
.TP
\fIpathName \f5dirty\fR ?\fIminx miny maxx maxy\fR?
Mark the area inside the given rectangle
((\fIminx\fP, \fIminy\fP), (\fImaxx\fP, \fImaxy\fP))
to be flushed to the screen. If the rectangle is not
given, the whole area will be marked.
The coordinates are relative to the image's origin.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5origin\fR ?\fIx y\fR?
Set the point within the image that will be displayed
at the top left of the panel's rectangle.
If the area allocated to the panel is more than
the area drawn by the image, the ``top left'' will
positioned with respect to the value of the
.B -anchor
option.
If the point is not given, the current origin
is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5panelx\fR ?\fIscreenx\fR?
Given a screen x-coordinate,
.IR screenx ,
this command returns the image x-coordinate displayed
at that location.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5panely\fR ?\fIscreeny\fR?
Given a screen y-coordinate,
.IR screeny ,
this command returns the image y-coordinate displayed
at that location.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5screenx\fR ?\fIpanelx\fR?
Given an image x-coordinate,
.IR panelx ,
this command returns the
equivalent screen x-coordinate.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5screeny\fR ?\fIpanely\fR?
Given an image y-coordinate,
.IR panely ,
this command returns the
equivalent screen y-coordinate.
.SH BINDINGS
When a new panel is created, it has no default event bindings.
