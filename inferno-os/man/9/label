.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.TP
.B -height \fIdist\fP
Specifies a desired height for the label.
If this option isn't specified, the label's desired height is computed
from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.
.TP
.B -width \fIdist\fP
Specifies a desired width for the label.
If this option isn't specified, the label's desired width is computed
from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f5label\fR command creates a new window (given by the
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a label widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
to configure aspects of the label such as its colours, font,
text, and initial relief.  The \f5label\fR command returns its
\fIpathName\fR argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named \fIpathName\fR.
.PP
A label is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.
If text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it
can occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines) and
one of the characters may optionally be underlined using the
\f5underline\fR option.
The label can be manipulated in a few simple ways, such as
changing its relief or text, using the commands described below.

.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
The \f5label\fR command creates a new Tk command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.RS
.EX
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.EE
.RE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behaviour of the command.  The following
commands are possible for label widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \f5cget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5label\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5configure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list of all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR.  If
one or more \fIoption-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5label\fR
command.

.SH BINDINGS
When a new label is created, it has no default event bindings:
labels are not intended to be interactive.
