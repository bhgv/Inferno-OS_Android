.B -command \fIcommand\fP
Specifies a Tk command to associate with the button.  This command
is typically invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the button
window.  The button's global variable (\f5-variable\fR option) will
be updated before the command is invoked.
.TP
.B -height \fIdist\fP
Specifies a desired height for the button.
If this option isn't specified, the button's desired height is computed
from the size of the highest item in the
.B -values
list.
.TP
.B -selectcolor \fIcolour\fP
Specifies a background colour to use when the button is selected.
If specified as an empty string, no special colour is used for
displaying when the widget is selected.

.B -values \fIlist\fP
Specifies a list of all the values the choicebutton can choose from.
.TP
.B -variable \fIstring\fP
Specifies name of global variable to set whenever this button is
selected. The variable will be set to the index of the currently
selected item. Changes in this variable also cause the button to
choose the appropriate item (provided it is an integer and within
range).
.TP
.B -width \fIdist\fP
Specifies a desired width for the button.
If this option isn't specified, the button's desired width is computed
from the size of the widest item in the

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f5choicebutton\fR command creates a new window (given by the
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a choicebutton widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
to configure aspects of the choicebutton such as its colours, font,
text, and initial relief.  The \f5choicebutton\fR command returns its
\fIpathName\fR argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named \fIpathName\fR.
.PP
A choicebutton is a widget that displays a textual string,
one of the items given in the
.I list
argument to the
.B -values
option.
When clicked on, the choicebutton displays a menu showing
all the available choices, allowing the user to change
the choice by selecting an item.
In the description below, an
.I index
is a zero-based index into the set of values specified with
the
.B -values
option.
.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
The \f5choicebutton\fR command creates a new Tk command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.RS
.EX
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.EE
.RE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behaviour of the command.  The following
commands are possible for choicebutton widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \f5cget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5choicebutton\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5configure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list of all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR.  If
one or more \fIoption-value\fR pairs are specified, the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5choicebutton\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5get\fR ?\fIvalue\fR?
Get the index of the first item with
.IR value .
If
.I value
is not given, get the index of the currently selected item.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5set\fR \fIindex\fR
Sets the current item to the
.IR index th
value.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5getvalue\fR ?\fIindex\fR?
Get the value of the
.IR index th
item. If
.I index
is not given, get the value of the currently selected item.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5setvalue\fR \fIvalue\fR
Set the current item to the first item having
.IR value .
If no item has that value, no change is made,
and an error is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5invoke\fR \fIindex\fR
Does just what would have happened if the user invoked the choicebutton
with the mouse and selected the item at
.IR index :
sets the current item to
.I index
and runs
its associated Tk command, if there is one.
The return value is that from invoking the Tk command, or an
empty string if there is no associated command.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5valuecount\fR
Returns the number of values configured in the choicebutton.
