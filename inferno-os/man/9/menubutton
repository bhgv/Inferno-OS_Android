.EE
.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI -height \ state
Specifies a desired height for the menubutton.
If this option is not specified, the menubutton's desired height is computed
from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.
.TP
.BI -menu \ widgetname
Specifies the path name of the menu associated with this menubutton.
The menu must be a child of the menubutton.
.TP
.BI -state \ state
Specifies one of three states for the menubutton:  \f5normal\fR, \f5active\fR,
or \f5disabled\fR.  In normal state the menubutton is displayed using the
\f5foreground\fR and \f5background\fR options.  The active state is
typically used when the pointer is over the menubutton.  In active state
the menubutton is displayed using the \f5activeforeground\fR and
\f5activebackground\fR options.  Disabled state means that the menubutton
should be insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate
the widget and will ignore mouse button presses.
In this state the \f5disabledcolor\fR and
\f5background\fR options determine how the button is displayed.
.TP
.BI -width \ dist
Specifies a desired width for the menubutton.
If this option is not specified, the menubutton's desired width is computed
from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.
.SH INTRODUCTION
.PP
The \f5menubutton\fR command creates a new window (given by the
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a menubutton widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified to configure aspects of the
menubutton such as its colors, font, text, and initial relief.
The \f5menubutton\fR command returns its
\fIpathName\fR argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named \fIpathName\fR.
.PP
A menubutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap, or image
and is associated with a menu widget.
If text is displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it
can occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines) and
one of the characters may optionally be underlined using the
\f5underline\fR option.
In normal usage, pressing
mouse button 1 over the menubutton causes the associated menu to
be posted just underneath the menubutton.
If the mouse button is released over the menubutton then the menu
remains posted; clicking on the menubutton again unposts the menu.
Releasing the mouse button over a menu entry invokes the entry, while
releasing mouse button elsewhere unposts the menu.
.PP
Menubuttons are typically organized into groups called menu bars
that allow scanning:
if the mouse button is pressed over one menubutton (causing it
to post its menu) and the mouse is moved over another menubutton
without releasing the mouse button, then the
menu of the first menubutton is unposted and the menu of the
new menubutton is posted instead.
.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
.PP
The \f5menubutton\fR command creates a new Tk command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.RS
.EX
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.EE
.RE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behaviour of the command.  The following
commands are possible for menubutton widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \f5cget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5menubutton\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5configure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list of all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR.
If one or more \fIoption-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5menubutton\fR
command.
.SH "DEFAULT BINDINGS"
Tk automatically creates class bindings for menubuttons that give them
the following default behaviour:
.IP [1]
A menubutton activates whenever the mouse passes over it and deactivates
whenever the mouse leaves it.
.IP [2]
Pressing mouse button 1 over a menubutton posts the menu specified by the
.B -menu
option.
If the menu is already posted then it is unposted.
.IP [3]
Releasing mouse button 1 over the menubutton leaves the menu posted.
Releasing the button over a menu entry, if the menu is posted, invokes that entry.
Releaseing the button anywhere else unposts the menu.
.IP [4]
When a menubutton is posted, its associated menu claims the input
focus to allow keyboard traversal of the menu and its submenus.
See the
.IR menu (9)
manual entry for details on these bindings.
.PP
If the menubutton's state is \f5disabled\fR then none of the above
actions occur:  the menubutton is completely non-responsive.
.PP
The behaviour of menubuttons can be changed by defining new bindings for
individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.
