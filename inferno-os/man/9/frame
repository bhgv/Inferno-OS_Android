.SH SYNOPSIS
\f5frame\fI \fIpathName ?\fIoptions\fR?
.SH STANDARD OPTIONS
.EX
-borderwidth -relief
.EE
.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.TP
.B -background \fIcolour\fP
This option is the same as the standard \f5background\fR option
except that its value may also be specified as an empty string.
In this case, the widget will display no background or border, and
no colours will be consumed from its colourmap for its background
and border.
.TP
.B -height \fIdist\fP
Specifies the desired height for the window.
If this option is less than or equal to zero then the window will
not request any size at all.
.TP
.B -width \fIdist\fP
Specifies the desired width for the window.
If this option is less than or equal to zero then the window will
not request any size at all.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f5frame\fR command creates a new window (given by the
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a frame widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
to configure aspects of the frame such as its background colour
and relief.  The \f5frame\fR command returns the
path name of the new window.
.PP
A frame is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a
spacer or container for complex window layouts.  The only features
of a frame are its background colour and an optional 3-D border to make the
frame appear raised or sunken.

.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
The \f5frame\fR command creates a new Tk command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.. This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.RS
.EX
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.EE
.RE
\fIPathName\fR is the name of the command, which is the same as
the frame widget's path name.  \fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behaviour of the command.  The following
commands are possible for frame widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \f5cget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5frame\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \f5configure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? \fI?value option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list of all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR.  If
one or more \fIoption-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \f5frame\fR
command.

.SH BINDINGS
When a new frame is created, it has no default event bindings:
frames are not intended to be interactive.
