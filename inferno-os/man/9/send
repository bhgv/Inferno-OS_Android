.TH SEND 9
.SH NAME
send \- send a value down a Tk channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f5send \fIchan\fP \fIstring\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Send
is the gateway from the Tk world into the Limbo world.
It sends
.I string
down
.IR chan ,
which should previously have been named with a call to
.B namechan
(see
.IR tk (2)).
Tk channels are non blocking, so the call will return immediately,
whether the message has been sent or not. If too many messages
have been queued on the
.IR chan ,
then the message will be
discarded, and a warning printed on the console.
.I String
is not subject to interpretation by the usual Tk quoting rules.
.SH BUGS
.I String
is not subject to interpretation by the usual Tk quoting rules.
This means, for example that:
.EX
	radiobutton .x -text X -variable x -value x
	radiobutton .y -text Y -variable y -value y
	button .z -text Submit {send chan submit [variable X]}
.EE
will not work as expected. Instead, one must interrogate values
directly in Limbo.
.PP
The specialised queued channels will be replaced by buffered channels in Limbo in
a future edition of Inferno.
