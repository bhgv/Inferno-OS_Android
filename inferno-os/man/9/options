.TH OPTIONS 9
.SH NAME
options \- Standard options supported by widgets
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual entry describes the common configuration options supported
by widgets in the Tk toolkit.  Every widget does not necessarily support
every option (see the manual entries for individual widgets for a list
of the standard options supported by that widget), but if a widget does
support an option with one of the names listed below, then the option
has exactly the effect described below.
For a description of kinds of values that can passed to the various
options, see
.IR types (9).
.PP
In the descriptions below, the name refers to the
switch used in class commands and \f5configure\fR widget commands to
set this value.  For example, if an option's command-line switch is set to
\f5-foreground\fR and there exists a widget \f5.a.b.c\fR, then the
command
.RS
.EX
\&.a.b.c configure -foreground black
.EE
.RE
may be used to specify the value \f5black\fR for the option in the
the widget \f5.a.b.c\fR.
.TP
.BI -activebackground " colour"
Specifies background colour to use when drawing active elements.
An element (a widget or portion of a widget) is active if the
mouse cursor is positioned over the element and pressing a mouse button
will cause some action to occur.
.TP
.BI -activeforeground " colour"
Specifies foreground colour to use when drawing active elements.
See above for definition of active elements.
.TP
.BI -actx
Returns the current x position of the widget in screen coordinates.
.TP
.BI -acty
Returns the current y position of the widget in screen coordinates.
.TP
.BI -actwidth
Returns the current allocated width of the widget.
.TP
.BI -actheight
Returns the current allocated height of the widget.
.TP
.BI -anchor " val"
Specifies how the information in a widget (e.g. text or a bitmap)
is to be displayed in the widget.
.I Val
must be one of the values \f5n\fR, \f5ne\fR, \f5e\fR, \f5se\fR,
\f5s\fR, \f5sw\fR, \f5w\fR, \f5nw\fR, or \f5center\fR.
For example, \f5nw\fR means display the information such that its
top-left corner is at the top-left corner of the widget.
.TP
.B -background  \fIcolour\fP \fRor\fP -bg \fIcolour\fP
Specifies the normal background colour to use when displaying the
widget.
.TP
.BI -bitmap " bitmap"
Specifies a bitmap to display in the widget.
The exact way in which the bitmap is displayed may be affected by
other options such as \f5anchor\fR or \f5justify\fR.
Typically, if this option is specified then it overrides other
options that specify a textual value to display in the widget;
the \f5bitmap\fR option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable
a text display.
In widgets that support both \f5bitmap\fR and \f5image\fR options,
\f5image\fR will usually override \f5bitmap\fR.
For those widgets that support the \f5foreground\fR option, if the bitmap is
monochrome it is displayed using the foreground colour.
.TP
.B -borderwidth \fIdist\fP \fRor\fP -bd \fIdist\fP
Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width
of the 3-D border to draw around the outside of the widget (if such a
border is being drawn;  the \f5relief\fR option typically determines
this).  The value may also be used when drawing 3-D effects in the
interior of the widget.
.TP
.B -disabledcolor  \fIcolour\fP
Specifies the foreground colour to use when drawing disabled widgets.
Certain widgets can be disabled by use of their
.B -state
option.
.TP
.B -font \fIfont\fP
Specifies the font to use when drawing text inside the widget.
.TP
.B -foreground \fIcolour\fP or -fg \fIcolour\fP
Specifies the normal foreground colour to use when displaying the widget.
.TP
.B -highlightcolor \fIcolour\fP
Specifies the colour to use for the traversal highlight rectangle that is
drawn around the widget when it has the input focus.
.TP
.B -highlightthickness \fIdist\fP
Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the highlight
rectangle to draw around the outside of the widget when it has the
input focus.
If the value is zero, no focus highlight is drawn around the widget.
.TP
.B -image \fIimage\fP
Specifies an image to display in the widget, which must have been
created with the \f5image create\fR command.
Typically, if the \f5image\fR option is specified then it overrides other
options that specify a bitmap or textual value to display in the widget;
the \f5image\fR option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable
a bitmap or text display.
For those widgets that support the \f5foreground\fR option, if the image is
monochrome it is displayed using the foreground colour.
.TP
.B -jump \fIboolean\fP
For widgets with a slider that can be dragged to adjust a value,
such as scrollbars, this option determines when
notifications are made about changes in the value.
If the value is false, updates are made continuously as the
slider is dragged.
If the value is true, updates are delayed until the mouse button
is released to end the drag;  at that point a single notification
is made (the value ``jumps'' rather than changing smoothly).
.TP
.B -justify \fIval\fP
When there are multiple lines of text displayed in a widget, this
option determines how the lines line up with each other.
.I Val
must be one of \f5left\fR, \f5center\fR, or \f5right\fR.
\f5Left\fR means that the lines' left edges all line up, \f5center\fR
means that the lines' centers are aligned, and \f5right\fR means
that the lines' right edges line up.
.TP
.B -orient \fIorientation\fP
For widgets that can lay themselves out with either a horizontal
or vertical orientation, such as scrollbars, this option specifies
which orientation should be used.
.I Orientation
must be either \f5horizontal\fR
or \f5vertical\fR.
.TP
.B -padx \fIdist\fP
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space
to request for the widget in the X-direction.
When computing how large a window it needs, the widget will
add this amount to the width it would normally need (as determined
by the width of the things displayed in the widget);  if the geometry
manager can satisfy this request, the widget will end up with extra
internal space to the left and/or right of what it displays inside.
Most widgets only use this option for padding text:  if they are
displaying a bitmap or image, then they usually ignore padding
options.
.TP
.B -pady \fIdist\fP
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space
to request for the widget in the Y-direction.
When computing how large a window it needs, the widget will add
this amount to the height it would normally need (as determined by
the height of the things displayed in the widget);  if the geometry
manager can satisfy this request, the widget will end up with extra
internal space above and/or below what it displays inside.
Most widgets only use this option for padding text:  if they are
displaying a bitmap or image, then they usually ignore padding
options.
.TP
.B -relief \fIval\fP
Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the widget.  Acceptable
values for
.I val are \f5raised\fR, \f5sunken\fR, \f5flat\fR, \f5ridge\fR,
and \f5groove\fR.
The value
indicates how the interior of the widget should appear relative
to its exterior;  for example, \f5raised\fR means the interior of
the widget should appear to protrude from the screen, relative to
the exterior of the widget.
.TP
.B -selectbackground \fIcolour\fP
Specifies the background colour to use when displaying selected
items.
.TP
.B -selectborderwidth \fIdist\fP
Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width
of the 3-D border to draw around selected items.
.TP
.B -selectforeground \fIcolour\fP
Specifies the foreground colour to use when displaying selected
items.
.TP
.B -takefocus \fIboolean\fP
Determines whether clicking on the widget will automatically
give it the keyboard focus, and also whether the widget
will become part of the keyboard focus list and made accessible
by keyboard navigation.
.TP
.B -text \fIval\fP
Specifies a string,
.IR val ,
to be displayed inside the widget.  The way in which
the string is displayed depends on the particular widget and may be
determined by other options, such as \f5anchor\fR or \f5justify\fR.
.TP
.B -underline \fIinteger\fP
Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the widget.
This option is used by the default bindings to implement keyboard
traversal for menu buttons and menu entries.
0 corresponds to the first character of the text displayed in the
widget, 1 to the next character, and so on.
.TP
.B -xscrollcommand \fIcommand\fP
Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with horizontal
scrollbars.
When the view in the widget's window changes (or
whenever anything else occurs that could change the display in a
scrollbar, such as a change in the total size of the widget's
contents), the widget will
generate a Tk command by concatenating
.I command
and
two numbers.
Each of the numbers is a fraction between 0 and 1, which indicates
a position in the document.  0 indicates the beginning of the document,
1 indicates the end, .333 indicates a position one third the way through
the document, and so on.
The first fraction indicates the first information in the document
that is visible in the window, and the second fraction indicates
the information just after the last portion that is visible.
The command is
then passed to the Tk interpreter for execution.  Typically the
\f5-xscrollcommand\fR option consists of the path name of a scrollbar
widget followed by
.RB `` set '',
e.g.
.RB `` ".x.scrollbar set" '':
this will cause
the scrollbar to be updated whenever the view in the window changes.
If this option is not specified, then no command will be executed.
.TP
.B -yscrollcommand \fIcommand\fP
Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with vertical
scrollbars.  This option is treated in the same way as the
\f5-xscrollcommand\fR option, except that it is used for vertical
scrollbars and is provided by widgets that support vertical scrolling.
See the description of \f5-xscrollcommand\fR for details
on how this option is used.
