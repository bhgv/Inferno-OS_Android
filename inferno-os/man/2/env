.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Env
provides an interface to manipulate environment variables which may then be shared 
between processes.
.B Getenv
returns the value of the environment variable
.I var
passed as a parameter,
or
.B nil
if the variable is not set. It does
this by reading the contents of
.BI /env/ var.
.B Setenv
sets the value of the environment variable
.I var
to
.I val.
The value may be nil to unset the variable. It does this by writing the string
.I val
to
.BI /env/ var.
The routine returns a negative number if it fails to set the variable for any reason.
.B Getall
returns all the variables in the current environment as a list of (variable, value) pairs.
.B Clone
copies the current environment and places the process in a new environment group. Changes now
made to the environment will not affect the environment of other processes.
.B New
places the process in a new empty environment group. Changes made in this new environment will
not affect other processes.
