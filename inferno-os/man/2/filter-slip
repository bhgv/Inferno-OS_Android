.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Slip
provides the SLIP data framing protocol described by RFC1055.
The module is an implementation of the general data-processing module type
.BR Filter ;
see
.IR filter (2)
for details of that general interface.
.PP
.B Init
must be called before any other operation of the module.
.PP
.B Start
begins SLIP line encoding or decoding via the channel it returns,
following the protocol of
.IR filter (2).
.I Param
is one of the two following strings:
.TF encode
.PD
.TP
.B encode
The filter takes the block of data obtained by each
.B Rq.Fill
message, adds framing and escape characters as required,
and returns the resulting data block in an
.B Rq.Result
message.
.TP
.B decode
The filter operates on the data in
.B Rq.Fill
messages as a single stream of bytes, providing an
.B Rq.Result
message for each framed message found in the stream,
with escape characters processed to retrieve the original data.
