.TH SYS-FAUTH 2
.SH NAME
fauth \- set up authentication on a file descriptor to a file server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.EX

sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

fauth:  fn(fd: ref FD, aname: string): ref FD;
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Fauth
provides a means for the current user to authenticate to access
resources available through the 9P connection represented by
.IR fd .
The return value is a file descriptor, conventionally called
.IR afd ,
that is subsequently used to execute the authentication protocol
for the server.
After successful authentication,
.I afd
may be passed as the second argument to a subsequent
.B mount
call (see
.IR sys-bind (2)),
with the same
.IR aname,
as a ticket-of-entry for the user.
.PP
If
.B fauth
returns nil, the error case, that means the file server does not require
authentication for the connection, and
.I afd
should be nil
in the call to
.BR mount.
.ig
.PP
It is rare to use
.IR fauth
directly; more commonly
.I amount
(see
.IR auth (2))
is used.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

including the server not requiring authentication,
and
.B fauth
returns nil.
