.TH KEYRING-AUTH 2
.SH NAME
keyring: auth, readauthinfo, writeauthinfo \- authenticate a connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.EX
include "keyring.m";
keyring := load Keyring Keyring->PATH;
auth:           fn(fd: ref Sys->FD, info: ref Authinfo, setid: int)
                : (string, array of byte);
readauthinfo:   fn(filename: string): ref Authinfo;
writeauthinfo:  fn(filename: string, info: ref Authinfo): int;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Auth
performs mutual authentication over a network connection, usually between a client and a server.
The function is symmetric: each party runs it on their end of the connection.
.I Info
holds the public key of a certifying authority
.RB ( PKca ),
the private key of the user
.RB ( SKu ),
the public key
.RB ( PKu )
of the user signed by the certifying authority
.RB ( CERTu ),
and Diffie-Hellman parameters
.RB ( alpha ,
.BR p ).
.PP
.B Auth
returns a string and a byte array.
If the byte array is nil then the authentication has failed and the string is an error message. If the byte array is non-nil, it represents a secret shared by the two communicating parties,
and the string names the party at the other end of the connection.
.PP
If the authentication is successful and
.I setid
is non-zero then
.B auth
attempts to write the name of the party at the other end of the connection into
.B /dev/user
(see
.IR cons (3));
no error is generated if that does not succeed.
If the authentication is not successful and
.I setid
is non-zero,
.B auth
writes the name
.B nobody
into
.BR /dev/user .
.PP
The authentication protocol is based on the Station-to-Station protocol. In the following, the parties are labelled 0 and 1.
.BI Sig0( x )
is
.I x
signed with 0's private key.
.IP
.EX
0 → 1  alpha**r0 mod p, CERTu0, PKu0
1 → 0  alpha**r1 mod p, CERTu1, PKu1
0 → 1  sig0(alpha**r0 mod p, alpha**r1 mod p)
1 → 0  sig1(alpha**r0 mod p, alpha**r1 mod p)
.EE
.PP
At this point both 0 and 1 share the secret
.B "alpha**(r0*r1)"
which is returned in the byte array.
Amongst other things, it can be the secret to digest or encrypt a conversation
(see
.IR security-ssl (2)).
.PP
.B Readauthinfo
reads a representation of an
.B Authinfo
from a file.
It returns nil if there is a read error or a conversion error;
it returns a reference to the
.B Authinfo
otherwise.
.PP
.B Writeauthinfo
writes a representation of
.I info
to a file. It returns -1 if the write operation fails, 0 otherwise.
