.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FSproto
provides an interface to read a file system prototype file,
as defined by
.IR proto (6).
.PP
.B Init
must be called before any other function in the module.
.PP
.B Readprotofile
reads a file system prototype from the file
.IR proto .
It traverses the file system, starting at the given
.IR root ,
and each file or directory encountered that is mentioned
in the prototype causes
.B readprotofile
to send a
.B Direntry
tuple on the channel
.IR entries .
The tuple has the form
.BI ( old , new , dir\fP\f5)\fP
where
.I old
is the name of the current file or directory,
rooted at
.IR root ,
.I new
is the same file's name
.I relative
to
.IR root ,
and
.I dir
is a reference to the
.B Sys->Dir
directory information for
.IR old ,
as produced by
.IR sys-stat (2).
When all files in
.I root
have been examined,
.B readprotofile
sends a single tuple with all nil components on
.IR entries .
For each error that occurs during processing (eg, unable to open a directory)
.B readprotofile
sends a tuple
.BI ( old , diag )
on the channel
.IR warnings ,
naming the file and giving a diagnostic string,
but processing continues.
.PP
.B Readprotostring
reads a file system prototype from the string
.I proto
itself.
Otherwise, its operation is the same as
.BR readprotofile .
