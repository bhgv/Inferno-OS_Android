.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B Style
type collects the font and colour information for an application or a set of
items within an application.  Except when using the
.B layout
routines (see
.IR prefab-compound (2)
and
.IR prefab-element (2)),
the members of a
.B Style
are the only way to control the appearance of
.B Prefab
items.
Note that although the
.RB `... color'
members of
.B Style
in practice often refer to a literal colour (a single replicated pixel of colour),
they can be any image.
.PP
.B Styles
are allocated by regular Limbo definitions; there is no allocation function.
All the members of a
.B Style
must be defined.
Although it will not cause errors to modify the members of a
.B Style
after it has been created and passed to a
.B Prefab
routine, the results may be unpredictable.
