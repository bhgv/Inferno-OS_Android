.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Verifier
checks SPKI proof sequences.
This initial implementation provides a single basic operation.
Further work will allow (via channels and processes) verification
to detect and refresh expired credentials, to support `pull' authentication,
for instance.
.PP
.B Init
must be called before any other operation of the module.
.PP
A
.B Speaksfor
value represents a claim that a given
.I subject
entity
speaks for (on behalf of) a given
.I name
regarding a set of statements, with validity optionally limited to a given period.
That is, when during the agreed time,
.I subject
makes a statement that is in the agreed set, it is treated
as if
.I name
had said it directly.
The set of statements is defined by a SPKI `tag' expression, represented as
an S-expression.
In particular, the
.B "(tag (*))"
means that
.I subject
speaks for
.I name
about everything.
A claim can be taken as true if supported by acceptable evidence,
for instance a collection of signed certificates.
.PP
.B Verify
does the actual verification of a sequence
.I seq
of SPKI certificates, signatures and operations
that makes and supports a claim that an entity speaks for another.
It returns a tuple
.BI ( claim,\ badel,\ err ) .
On success,
.I claim
refers to a
.B Speaksfor
value that summaries the statement verified by the sequence.
On failure,
.I claim
is nil,
.I badel
is a list of sequence elements headed by the first element of
.I seq
that failed verification, and
.I err
is the reason it failed.
