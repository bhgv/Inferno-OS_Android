.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pslib
must first be initialised by calling
.B Init
with a loaded Bufio module.
.B Writeimage
writes a Postscript file containing the data within
.I img
to
.IR f ,
which should first have been opened for writing
by
.IR bufio .
.I Dpi
is a value specifying the pixel width of pixels in
.IR img ;
the width (and height) of
.I dpi
dots in
.I img
will be one inch when the Postscript is
rendered.

.SH SEE ALSO
.IR bufio (2),
.IR draw-image (2)
.SH BUGS
The resulting Postscript is really only suitable for
use as encapsulated Postscript, as there's no way
to set the destination paper size.
.PP
There should be many more useful functions
in this module.
