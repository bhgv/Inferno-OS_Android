.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Tftp
fetches files from an Internet TFTP server.
It is typically used only to fetch kernels or configuration files when booting.
Only one transfer can be active at any given time.
.PP
.B Init
must be called once before using any other function of the module.
If
.I progress
is non-zero,
.B receive
will periodically print a character as blocks are received:
.RB ` . '
for every 25 blocks,
.RB ` S '
for a sequence error,
.RB ` T '
for a timeout.
.PP
.B Receive
attempts to fetch the contents of
.I filename
from
.I host
and writes the blocks of data to
.I fd
as they are received.
It returns when the file transfer has completed,
returning a nil string on success or a diagnostic string otherwise.
When booting,
.I fd
is typically open on the
.B kexec
file of
.IR boot (3).
