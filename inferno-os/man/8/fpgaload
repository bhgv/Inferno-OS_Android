.TH FPGALOAD 8
.SH NAME
fpgaload \- configure FPGA
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auxi/fpgaload
[
.BI -c " clk"
]
.I file.rbf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fpgaload
configures the directly-attached Altera Flex6000 FPGA on the Bright Star Engineering ip-Engine.
It enables the FPGA and output of the external system clocks, then loads the FPGA with the contents of
.IR file.rbf
which should be in the `raw binary format' produced for example by the Altera tools.
After successful configuration, the BCLK is set to
.I clk
MHz;
.I clk
must be a divisor of the ip-Engine's system clock (currently 48 MHz).
