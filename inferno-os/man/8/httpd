.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Httpd
is a simple HTTP daemon, serving version 1.0 of the HTTP protocol.
It listens for incoming calls on a given
.I address
(default:
.BR tcp!*!80 ).
It serves content rooted at
.L /services/httpd/root
in its name space.
.PP
The
.I httpd
program supports only the
.L GET
and
.L HEAD
methods of the HTTP protocol. The
.L Content-type
(default
.LR application/octet-stream )
and
.L Content-encoding
(default
.LR binary )
of a file are determined by looking for suffixes of the file name in
.BR /services/http/http.suff .
.PP
If the requested URI begins with
.BR /magic/ ,
.I httpd
loads the module associated with the remaining part of the URI.
Take care to configure the name space sensibly.
Simple servers
.I echo
and
.I stats
are provided (see below).
.PP
.I Httpd
has the following options:
.TP
.BI -a " address"
Listen for calls on the given
.IR address ,
expressed using the syntax of
.IR dial (2).
.TP
.BI -c " cachesize"
Set the size of the daemon's cache to
.I cachesize
kilobytes. The default is a five megabyte cache.
.TP
.B -D
Debugging information is written to the file
.BR /services/httpd/httpd.debug .
.PP
.I Echo
is a trivial server that just returns the method, URI, any search, and the headers sent by the client.
.PP
.I Stats
is an equally simple server that queries the cache and returns information to the user about pages stored in the cache.
.PP
More complex services can be written to
.IR httpd 's
private interface.
The file
.B httpd.m
(in
.BR /appl/svc/httpd )
defines constants and adts used by
.IR httpd .
The file
.B cgi.m
defines the
module
.L Cgi
which is the interface for programs called using the URI
.BR /magic/ .
