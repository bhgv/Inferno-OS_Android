.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rip
implements the Internet RIP routing protocol
described by RFC1058 and RFC2453.
It watches the network and makes appropriate changes
to the machine's Internet routing table
(see
.B iproute
in
.IR ip (3)),
based on routing packets
broadcast by gateways on the network.
.I Rip
is only used when a single default gateway is inadequate,
typically because a machine sits on a network directly connected to
several others,
having no common gateway or router.
On networks where there is just one gateway, it is usually simpler and more efficient
to configure that statically using
.IR ndb (6)
or dynamically using DHCP/BOOTP,
rather than running
.IR rip .
.PP
.I Rip
serves the network on
.I mntpt
(default:
.BR /net ).
When it starts,
.I rip
learns its own interfaces and directly attached networks by reading
.IB mntpt /ipifc ,
and notes any routes currently in
.IB mntpt /iproute .
.PP
By default,
.I rip
neither broadcasts routes nor replies to requests for its route table.
If the
.B \-b
option is given,
.I rip
periodically broadcasts changes to its routing table to each of its interfaces.
If at least one explicit
.I net
address is given, the broadcasts are restricted to just the interfaces listed
(and
.B \-b
is implied).
.PP
The
.B \-d
option causes
.I routed
to record changes it makes to the routing tables.
This can be helpful when locating misleading announcements
from rogue gateways.
A second
.B \-d
will include detailed information about every packet.
The
.B \-n
option tells
.I rip
not to change the local routing table, but only say what changes it would have made.
.PP
.I Rip
understands both version1 and version 2 of the protocol,
and interprets updates from gateways appropriately.
By default, it transmits updates using version 1; if the
.B -2
option is given, it uses version 2 instead, which is preferable when
the network has subnets.
