.TH MANGALOAD 8
.SH NAME
mangaload \- send new kernel to MANGA bootstrap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auxi/mangaload
[
.B -48dr
]
.I host
.I image
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mangaload
uses an ICMP protocol unique to the Peplink MANGAâ„¢ firewall to send a new kernel
.I image
to the MANGA bootstrap monitor to burn into flash, replacing
the existing kernel image.
To start the loading process, connect to the device's console on its serial port
(38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control),
power the device off then on again, and when the
.B MANGA
prompt appears, quickly type the letter
.BR f .
Then run
.I mangaload
to load the kernel; the device should give status updates as the kernel loads,
and as it burns the image into flash.
When it has finished, power the device off and on again to start the new kernel.
.PP
By default,
.I mangaload
assumes a 4 Mbyte flash on the device; the
.B -8
option sets it to 8 Mbytes.
The
.B -r
option causes the
.I image
to be loaded into another, larger flash region, used by Linux for its initial root,
which can be used by Inferno for general storage.
The
.B -d
option prints a trace of the protocol, for debugging.
