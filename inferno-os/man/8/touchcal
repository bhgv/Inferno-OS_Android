.TH TOUCHCAL 8
.SH NAME
touchcal \- touch screen calibration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B touchcal
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Touchcal
draws a cross-hair in each corner of the screen in turn (clockwise from the lower left hand corner),
and waits each time for the user to touch the centre of the cross-hair with the stylus.
It then prompts with a final cross-hair in the centre of the screen, and waits once
more for the user to touch its centre with the stylus.
The process is repeated until
.I touchcal
can calculate a transformation matrix that consistently maps the touch panel to screen
coordinates.
It then writes corresponding calibration commands for
.IR touch (3)
on its standard output, which
can be saved in a file on the device, perhaps
provided in NVRAM by
.IR tinyfs (3)
or a file system in
.IR ftl (3).
.PP
.I Touchcal
can be used both inside and outside the
.IR wm (1)
environment,
allowing calibration when the system is initialised, and whilst
the window system is running.
