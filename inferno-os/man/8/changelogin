.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Changelogin
helps to administer a password file
.B /keydb/keys
(see
.IR keys (6)),
a requirement of `signer' servers
(see
.IR logind (8),
.IR signer (8),
and
.B svc/auth
in
.IR svc (8)).
.I Changelogin
can only be used on the signing host itself,
after
.IR keyfs (4)
has been started (eg, by
.BR svc/auth )
to make the entries visible in the name space.
.PP
If a password file entry for
.I name
exists, it is modified; otherwise, a new entry is created.
The user is prompted for the following items:
.TP
password
A string at least 8 characters in length. The SHA-1 digest of the entered string is stored in the password file. See
.IR keyring-sha1 (2).
By default, the password for an existing entry is unchanged.
.TP
expiration date
An expiration time in the format
.IR DDMMYYYY .
The user input is checked for valid day, month, and year; moreover, the new date must be later than the current time.
By default, the current value, if any, is unchanged for an existing entry and one year from the current time for a new entry.
.ig
.TP
free form info
Arbitrary administrative information.
..
.PP
Note that the
password expiration date is also used as the default expiration date
for any certificate later produced;
see
.IR getauthinfo (8).
.PP
.I Convpasswd
converts a Third Edition
password file
to the
.IR keys (6)
file used by the current Edition of the system.
It reads password entries from
.IR pwfile ,
.B /keydb/password
by default,
and writes corresponding entries into
a name space served by
.IR keyfs (4),
mounted at
.IR keydir ,
.B /mnt/keys
by default.
It copies passwords and expiry times.
The `free form' administrative data is discarded.
If
.I keydir
already has got an entry for a user, it is left as-is, unless
the
.B -f
option is given to force
.I convpasswd
to copy across the entry in
.I pwfile .
The
.B -v
option causes
.I convpasswd
to print each user name after it successfully installs it.
