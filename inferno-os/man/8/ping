.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ping
sends ICMP echo requests to a network
.I destination
(which has the syntax accepted by
.IR dial (2)).
The target host, if up, should send a corresponding reply.
By default, one line is printed for each reply,
containing the sequence number (starting at 0) of the message it answers,
the round trip time for that reply, the average round trip time so far,
and the `time to live' value from the reply packet.
