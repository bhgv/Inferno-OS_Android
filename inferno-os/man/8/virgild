.TH VIRGILD 8
.SH NAME
virgild \- connection service for remote clients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ndb/cs
.br
.B ip/virgild
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Virgild
receives requests for name service on UDP/IP
port
.BR virgil ,
defined as
2202 by
.IR services (6),
and hard-coded in
.IR virgil (2).
Each request has the form:
.IP
.IB userid ? machine-name
.PP
.I Virgild
translates the
.I machine-name
using the local connection server
(see
.IR cs (8)),
and sends a response of the following form to the requesting client:
.IP
.IB userid ? machine-name = network-address
.PP
If the
.I machine-name
cannot be translated,
.I virgild
makes no response;
unless another server replies, the client's request will time out.
.PP
.I Virgild
requires that
.IR cs (8)
be running before it is started.

.SH BUGS
The
.I userid
part is currently unused but must still be included.
.br
.I Virgild
is single threaded: a delay in translating a name for one client will delay response
to any subsequent clients.
