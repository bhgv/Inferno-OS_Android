.SH NAME
rstyxd \- Styx-based remote execution and file service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auxi/rstyxd

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Rstyxd
provides a remote-execution service.
Having authorised the client and optionally established
.IR ssl ,
as described above,
it reads a single line from its standard input.
The line contains a decimal value that is the count of the number
of bytes that follow,
which
.I rstyxd
reads as a
.IR utf (6)-encoded
string.
The string contains a command, which is parsed into arguments,
following the quoting
conventions of
.IR sh (1).
The first argument is the command name.
.I Rstyxd
prepares a modified name space in which
to run the command.
It mounts the connection (standard input) on
.BR /n/client ,
binds
.BR /n/client/dev
onto
.BR /dev ,
and opens the new
.B /dev/cons
(ie, the remote client's
.BR /dev/cons )
on file descriptors 0, 1 and 2.
Finally, it executes the command.
.PP
.I Rstyxd
is normally started by
.IR svc (8)
in response to incoming network calls.
It expects the standard input to be connected to the client;
unusually, it is both read and written.
It
first authenticates the incoming call using
.IR keyring-auth (2)
via
.IR security-auth (2).
On successful authorisation, the server sets
its user identity to that of the caller,
and the client can request that a digest and/or encryption
algorithm be applied using
.IR ssl (3)
to protect the data exchanged with the server.
Each
.I alg
names a digest or encryption algorithm that the server will allow
the client to use,
in any form accepted by
.IR ssl ;
the special name
.B none
is usually listed, to allow the client to choose not to use
.IR ssl .
