.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bootpd
listens for Internet BOOTP requests and broadcasts a suitable reply
to each request that matches an entry
in the network database
.I dbfile
(default:
.BR /lib/ndb/local ).
The BOOTP protocol is typically used by a remote system as it boots, to obtain its Internet address
and other configuration data such as the addresses of servers
(see for instance the
.B bootp
file in
.IR ip (3)).
.PP
.I Dbfile
is in
.IR ndb (6)
format, as interpreted by
.IR attrdb (2).
.I Bootpd
uses the following attributes:
.TF ipmask
.TP
.B auth
authentication server name or address
.TP
.B bootf
name of the client's boot file
.TP
.B dom
fully-qualified domain name
.TP
.B ether
hardware (MAC) address; only Ethernet is supported
.TP
.B fs
file server name or address
.TP
.B ip
client's Internet address
.TP
.B ipgw
gateway from client's subnet (IP address)
.TP
.B ipmask
subnet mask
.TP
.B ipnet
network name
.TP
.B sys
system name (client identifier)
.PD
.PP
.I Bootpd
replies to an incoming request only if its hardware address matches the value of the
.B ether
attribute of an entry in
.I dbfile .
If found, the reply contains all the other requested data that is contained in the entry;
if an item is missing, it is sought in the entries for successively higher networks (described by
.B ipnet
entries) that contain the requesting system's address.
The `vendor specific' part of the reply conveys the file server and authentication server addresses
to Inferno clients.
Before answering a request,
.I bootpd
rereads
.I dbfile
if it has changed since last read.
.PP
The
.B -s
option causes
.I bootpd
to sniff the network for BOOTP traffic and print it, but not reply.
The
.B -d
option prints debugging information; giving it twice prints even more.
The
.B -x
option tells
.I bootpd
to use a
.I network
other than
.BR /net .
Currently
.I bootpd
prints a message to standard output each time it replies; the
.B -q
option keeps it quiet.
.PP
.I Tftpd
is mainly used to send kernels and configuration files to machines booting from the network.
It listens for incoming TFTP file transfer requests on the given UDP
.I port
(default: 69) and responds by sending or receiving a file as requested.
.I Homedir
is the current directory for transfers,
.B /services/tftpd
by default,
and requests that use a relative path name refer to files in or below that directory.
If the
.B -r
option is given, absolute path names are also restricted to
.IR homedir .
.I Tftpd
runs as
.B none
(the least privileged user) and can send only files with general read permission, or write files
that are generally writable.
Normally
.I tftpd
uses the network directory
.BR /net ,
but another can be specified with the
.B -x
option.
The
.B -d
option prints a debugging trace on standard output.
