.TH FTL 8
.SH NAME
ftl \- Flash Translation Layer formatter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disk/ftl
.I flashsize
.I secsize
.I kfsfile
.I output
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ftl
reads a file system image in
.IR kfs (3)
format from
.I kfsfile
and adds the data structures needed to make it a valid image for
the Flash Translation Layer driver
.IR ftl (3).
The result is written to the
.I output
file, which can be copied to initialise the
flash memory of a suitable device
(see
.IR flash (3)).
.PP
The other arguments describe the characteristics of the flash memory:
.TF \fIflashsize\fP
.PD
.TP
.I flashsize
The size in bytes of the flash memory to which
.I output
will be copied; exactly
.I flashsize
bytes will be written to
.IR output .
.TP
.I secsize
The effective erase unit (sector) size in bytes of the flash memory, as seen
by the processor, having
allowed for bus width.
For example, a bank of flash
formed from byte-wide flash chips, each with 16kbyte sectors,
wired across a 4 byte bus, might have an effective erase unit size of
64kbytes.
.PP
The
.I kfsfile
must not be larger than the size (length) of the
.B ftldata
file provided by
.IR ftl (3)
for the target flash device or partition.
(That size is invariably less than the size of the raw flash,
owing to the overhead of FTL data structures
and a reserve pool of 5% to reduce the number of erase cycles; see
.IR ftl (3)).
