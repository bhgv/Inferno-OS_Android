.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Eve
is a null-terminated string containing the name of the privileged user, often called
the `host owner', in
the Inferno system.
The default identity in native systems is
.LR inferno ,
and in hosted Inferno it is the user who started
.IR emu (1).
The initial process created by system initialisation is given the
.I eve
identity.
.PP
.I Iseve
returns true if the current user is
.IR eve .
Several drivers use
.I iseve
to check the caller's identity
before granting permission to perform certain actions.
For example, the console driver allows only the user
.I eve
to write a new identity into the
.B /dev/user
file.
The privileges are strictly local and do not extend into the network
(in particular, to file servers).
.PP
Note that the comparison performed by
.I iseve
is case-sensitive, even when running hosted on systems where
usernames are case-insensitive.
