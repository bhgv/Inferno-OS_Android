.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntsrv
.B add
.IR "svcname rootdir cmd" " [" arg " ... ]"
.PP
.B ntsrv

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ntsrv
is a command (for Windows only) that allows hosted Inferno
to run automatically as a Windows service, under Windows 2000 and XP.
For Windows NT, use the command
.BR ntsrv4 ,
which otherwise has identical interface.
.I Svcname
is the (proposed) Windows service name;
.I rootdir
is the root of the Inferno directory tree,
including the drive letter.
Once added, a service can be controlled using the Windows service manager:
it may be stopped, started, or have its attributes changed.
.I Svcname
is set to start automatically when Windows starts up.
Services run by default under the local Windows `System' identity.
All Windows processes and threads the service creates (eg, using
.IR cmd (3))
are destroyed when the service is stopped.
There may be many different services, each with a distinct
.IR svcname .
.PP
.I Ntsrv 's
first parameter tells it what to do:

that when started will invoke
.IR emu (1)
to run the Inferno command
.I cmd
with any additional arguments.
.TP
.B del
Delete an existing service
.IR svcname .
.PP
.I Ntsrv
requires the directory

(ie,

and

itself.
