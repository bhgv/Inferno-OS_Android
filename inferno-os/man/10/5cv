.SH DESCRIPTION
These commands convert a kernel executable in Inferno/Plan 9
.IR a.out (10.5)
format into another
format used by a third party's boot loader.
Most convert the input
.I executable
and write the new format to
.IR outfile .
.PP
.IR 5cv
converts an ARM executable into one of several alternative formats.
The output format is controlled by the
.B -H
option:
.TP 8n
.BI -H1
AIF for RISCOS.
.TP
.BI -H2
Plan 9.
.TP
.BI -H3
Boot for NetBSD.
.TP
.BI -H4
Headerless, stripped, and padded to 2K in length. Used for the ROM resident serial
bootstrap
loader in a Cirrus EP72xx.
.TP
.BI -H5
Headerless, and stripped, for general use.
.TP
.BI -H6
EPOC IMG format. Not a complete conversion, currently sufficient for use with some
NT based downloaders which autosense the file type by the "EP" signature, and then
ignore the contents of the header.
.PP
The other options are:
.TP
.BI -s
Strip symbol table.
.TP
.BI -D n
Enables debug output.
.PP
.I Mkppcimage
converts a PowerPC or ARM
.I executable
to a boot image format used by
.SM PPCBOOT
and
.SM UBOOT\c
\&.
The output file has a
.SM PPCBOOT
image with one component labelled as an `OS kernel' for the appropriate architecture,
containing the
.IR a.out (10.6)
header, text and initialised data, all uncompressed.
Symbols are not included.
By default the load address is deduced from the executable's entry point;
the
.B -l
option allows
.I loadaddr
to be set explicitly, with the number in C syntax (decimal by default).
Other attributes are deduced from the executable.
.PP
.I Sqz
squeezes (compresses) the given
ARM or PowerPC
.I executable
using a method that achieves respectable compression for executables but is much faster to decompress than
(say)
.BR gzip 's.
By default, both the program text and initialised data are compressed; the
.B -t
option causes
.I sqz
to compress only the program text, leaving the data as-is.
By default,
.I sqz
prints compression statistics on its standard error output;
the
.B -w
option causes it also to write the compressed file on its standard output.
Either the bootstrap that loads it must decompress the result, or a small uncompressed
stub must also be loaded that decompresses the remainder.
