.TH DBSRV 7 emu
.SH NAME
dbsrv \- ODBC database server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lib/dbsrv
.I alg
\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dbsrv
is normally configured to be run by
.IR svc (8)
on a machine that acts as database server,
for access through the module
.IR db (7).
.PP
The incoming call is authenticated by
.IR security-auth (2).
After successful authorisation, the client can request that a digest and/or encryption
algorithm be applied to protect the data exchanged with the server.
Each
.I alg
names a digest or encryption algorithm that the server will allow
the client to use,
in any form accepted by
.IR ssl (3);
the special name
.B none
means that
.I ssl
need not be used.
.PP
The implementation of
.I dbsrv
relies on a program external to Inferno,
.BR infdb ,
which translates between the
.IR db (7)
internal format for requests, and data base access calls on the host.
.I Dbsrv
invokes
.B infdb
using the
.IR cmd (3)
device.
Currently
.B infdb
is implemented only under Windows/NT, giving
access via ODBC to a Microsoft Access data base.
