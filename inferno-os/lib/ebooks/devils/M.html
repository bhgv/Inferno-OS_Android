<p class="entry"><span class="def">macrobian</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> One
forgotten of the gods and living to a great age. History is abundantly supplied
with examples, from Methuselah to Old Parr, but some notable instances of
longevity are less well known. A Calabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753,
lived so long that he had what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal
peace. Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he
could remember a time when he did not deserve hanging. In 1566 a linen draper
of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five hundred years, and that in
all that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity
(<i>macrobiosis</i>) in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to
know better. The editor of <i>The American</i>,
a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes back to the time when he
was a rascal, but not to the fact. The President of the United States was born
so long ago that many of the friends of his youth have risen to high political
and military preferment without the assistance of personal merit. The verses
following were written by a macrobian:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="poetry">When I was young the world was fair</p>
<p class="poetry">And amiable and sunny.</p>
<p class="poetry">A brightness was in all the air,</p>
<p class="poetry">In all the waters, honey.</p>

<p class="poetry">‘Twas true enough to tell.</p>
<p class="poetry">Men were not ranting, shouting, reeking,</p>
<p class="poetry">Nor women “generally speaking.”</p>

<p class="poetry"> In calling that a year</p>
<p class="poetry">Which does no more than just commence</p>
<p class="poetry">Before the end is near?</p>
<p class="poetry">When I was young the year extended</p>
<p class="poetry">From month to month until it ended.</p>
<p class="poetry">I know not why the world has changed</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">mad</span>, <span class="pos">adj.</span> Affected
with a high degree of intellectual independence; not conforming to standards of
thought, speech and action derived by the conformants from study of themselves;
at odds with the majority; in short, unusual. It is noteworthy that persons are
pronounced mad by officials destitute of evidence that themselves are sane. For
illustration, this present (and illustrious) lexicographer is no firmer in the
faith of his own sanity than is any inmate of any madhouse in the land; yet for
aught he knows to the contrary, instead of the lofty occupation that seems to
him to be engaging his powers he may really be beating his hands against the
window bars of an asylum and declaring himself Noah Webster, to the innocent
delight of many thoughtless spectators.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">Magdalene</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> An
inhabitant of Magdala. Popularly, a woman found out. This definition of the
word has the authority of ignorance, Mary of Magdala being another person than
the penitent woman mentioned by St. Luke. It has also the official sanction of
the governments of Great Britain and the United States. In England the word is
pronounced Maudlin, whence maudlin, adjective, unpleasantly sentimental. With
their Maudlin for Magdalene, and their Bedlam for Bethlehem, the English may
justly boast themselves the greatest of revisers.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">magic</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> An art
of converting superstition into coin. There are other arts serving the same
high purpose, but the discreet lexicographer does not name them.</p>

<p class="indentpara">The two definitions immediately foregoing are condensed from the works of one thousand
eminent scientists, who have illuminated the subject with a great white light,

<p class="entry"><span class="def">magnificient</span>, <span class="pos">adj.</span> Having

as the ears of an ass, to a rabbit, or the glory of a glowworm, to a maggot.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">magnitude</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Size.
Magnitude being purely relative, nothing is large and nothing small. If
everything in the universe were increased in bulk one thousand diameters
nothing would be any larger than it was before, but if one thing remain
unchanged all the others would be larger than they had been. To an
understanding familiar with the relativity of magnitude and distance the spaces
and masses of the astronomer would be no more impressive than those of the
microscopist. For anything we know to the contrary, the visible universe may be
a small part of an atom, with its component ions, floating in the life- fluid
(luminiferous ether) of some animal. Possibly the wee creatures peopling the
corpuscles of our own blood are overcome with the proper emotion when
contemplating the unthinkable distance from one of these to another.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">magpie</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A bird
whose thievish disposition suggested to someone that it might be taught to talk.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">maiden</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A young
person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless conduct and views that madden to
crime. The genus has a wide geographical distribution, being found wherever
sought and deplored wherever found. The maiden is not altogether unpleasing to
the eye, nor (without her piano and her views) insupportable to the ear, though
in respect to comeliness distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with regard
to the part of her that is audible, bleating out of the field by the
canary—which, also, is more portable.</p>

famous soldiers have been of the same way of thinking.</p>

Mh.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">molecule</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> The
ultimate, indivisible unit of matter. It is distinguished from the corpuscle,
also the ultimate, indivisible unit of matter, by a closer resemblance to the
atom, also the ultimate, indivisible unit of matter. Three great scientific
theories of the structure of the universe are the molecular, the corpuscular
and the atomic. A fourth affirms, with Haeckel, the condensation of
precipitation of matter from ether—whose existence is proved by the
condensation of precipitation. The present trend of scientific thought is
toward the theory of ions. The ion differs from the molecule, the corpuscle and
the atom in that it is an ion. A fifth theory is held by idiots, but it is
doubtful if they know any more about the matter than the others.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">monad</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> The
ultimate, indivisible unit of matter. (See <i>Molecule</i>.)
According to Leibnitz, as nearly as he seems willing to be understood, the
monad has body without bulk, and mind without manifestation—Leibnitz knows him
by the innate power of considering. He has founded upon him a theory of the
universe, which the creature bears without resentment, for the monad is a
gentlmean. Small as he is, the monad contains all the powers and possibilities
needful to his evolution into a German philosopher of the first class&#8212;
altogether a very capable little fellow. He is not to be confounded with the
microbe, or bacillus; by its inability to discern him, a good microscope shows
him to be of an entirely distinct species.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">monarch</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
person engaged in reigning. Formerly the monarch ruled, as the derivation of
the word attests, and as many subjects have had occasion to learn. In Russia
and the Orient the monarch has still a considerable influence in public affairs
and in the disposition of the human head, but in western Europe political
administration is mostly entrusted to his ministers, he being somewhat
preoccupied with reflections relating to the status of his own head.</p>

animal which strews its path with fainting women. As in Rome Christians were
thrown to the lions, so centuries earlier in Otumwee, the most ancient and
famous city of the world, female heretics were thrown to the mice. Jakak-Zotp,
the historian, the only Otumwump whose writings have descended to us, says that
these martyrs met their death with little dignity and much exertion. He even
attempts to exculpate the mice (such is the malice of bigotry) by declaring
that the unfortunate women perished, some from exhaustion, some of broken necks
from falling over their own feet, and some from lack of restoratives. The mice,
he avers, enjoyed the pleasures of the chase with composure. But if “Roman
history is nine-tenths lying,” we can hardly expect a smaller proportion of
