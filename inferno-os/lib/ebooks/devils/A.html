<p class="entry"><span class="def">abasement,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> A decent and customary
mental attitude in the presence of wealth of power. Peculiarly appropriate in an employee when addressing
an employer.</p>
   
<p class="entry"><span class="def">abatis,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> Rubbish in front of a fort,
to prevent the rubbish outside from molesting the rubbish inside.</p>

<p class="entry" id="abdication"><span class="def">abdication,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> An act
whereby a sovereign attests his sense of the high temperature of the throne.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="po">Poor Isabella&rsquo;s Dead, whose abdication</p>
<p class="po">Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish nation.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">abdomen,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> The temple of the god
Stomach, in whose worship, with sacrificial rights, all true men engage. From women this ancient faith commands but a
stammering assent. They sometimes minister at the altar in a half-hearted and ineffective way, but true reverence
for the one deity that men really adore they know not. If woman had a free hand in the world&rsquo;s
marketing the race would become graminivorous.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">ability,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> The natural equipment to accomplish
some small part of the meaner ambitions distinguishing able men from dead ones. In the last analysis ability is commonly
found to consist mainly in a high degree of solemnity. Perhaps, however, this impressive quality is
rightly appraised; it is no easy task to be solemn.</p>
            
<p class="entry"><span class="def">abnormal,</span> <span class="pos">adj.</span> Not conforming to
standard. In matters of thought and conduct, to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal is to
be detested. Wherefore the lexicographer adviseth a striving toward the straiter resemblance of the
Average Man than he hath to himself. Whoso attaineth thereto shall have peace, the prospect of death
and the hope of Hell.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">aboriginies,</span>  <span class="pos">n.</span> Persons of little worth found             
cumbering the soil of a newly discovered country. They soon cease to cumber; they fertilize.</p>

<p class="entry" id="ass"><span class="def">ass,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> A public singer with
a good voice but no ear. In Virginia City, Nevada, he is called the Washoe Canary, in Dakota, the Senator,
and everywhere the Donkey. The animal is widely and variously celebrated in the literature, <a href="#art">art</a>
and <a href="R.html#religion">religion</a> of every age and country; no other so engages and fires the human
imagination as this noble vertebrate. Indeed, it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, <span xml:lang="la"><i>lib. II.,
De Clem.</i></span>, and C. Stantatus, <span xml:lang="la"><i>De Temperamente</i></span>)
if it is not a god; and as such we know it was worshiped by the Etruscans, and, if we may believe Macrobious,
by the Cupasians also. Of the only two animals admitted into the Mahometan Paradise along with the souls of
men, the ass that carried Balaam is one, the <a href="D.html#dog">dog</a> of the Seven Sleepers the other.
This is no small distinction. From what has been written about this beast might be compiled a library of great
splendor and magnitude, rivalling that of the Shakespearean cult, and that which clusters about the Bible. It
may be said, generally, that all literature is more or less Asinine.</p>

is believed by the learned Marcus Ansello Scrutator to have suggested the <a href="C.html#christian">Christian</a>
rite of <a href="B.html#baptism">baptism</a> by immersion. This, however, has been shown by Lactantius to be
an error.</p>
