<p class="entry"><span class="def">rabble</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> In a
republic, those who exercise a supreme authority tempered by fraudulent
elections. The rabble is like the sacred Simurgh, of Arabian fable—omnipotent
on condition that it do nothing. (The word is Aristocratese, and has no exact
equivalent in our tongue, but means, as nearly as may be, “soaring swine.”)</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">rack</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> An
argumentative implement formerly much used in persuading devotees of a false

<p class="entry"><span class="def">rarebit</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
Welsh rabbit, in the speech of the humorless, who point out that it is not a
rabbit. To whom it may be solemnly explained that the comestible known as
toad-in-a-hole is really not a toad, and that <i>riz-de-veau
a la financiere</i> is not the smile of a calf prepared after the recipe
of a she banker.</p>

to a certain order of architecture, otherwise known as the Normal American. Most
of the public buildings of the United States are of the Ramshackle order,
though some of our earlier architects preferred the Ironic. Recent additions to
the White House in Washington are Theo-Doric, the ecclesiastic order of the
Dorians. They are exceedingly fine and cost one hundred dollars a brick.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">redemption</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Deliverance
of sinners from the penalty of their sin, through their murder of the deity
against whom they sinned. The doctrine of Redemption is the fundamental mystery
of our holy religion, and whoso believeth in it shall not perish, but have
everlasting life in which to try to understand it.</p>

without satisfaction.</p>

<p>Among the Anglo-Saxon a subject conceiving himself wronged by the king was permitted, on
proving his injury, to beat a brazen image of the royal offender with a switch
that was afterward applied to his own naked back. The latter rite was performed
by the public hangman, and it assured moderation in the plaintiff’s choice of a switch.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">red-skin</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A

that mostly satisfies reformers opposed to reformation.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">refuge</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Anything
assuring protection to one in peril. Moses and Joshua provided six cities of
refuge—Bezer, Golan, Ramoth, Kadesh, Schekem and Hebron—to which one who had
taken life inadvertently could flee when hunted by relatives of the deceased. This
admirable expedient supplied him with wholesome exercise and enabled them to
enjoy the pleasures of the chase; whereby the soul of the dead man was
appropriately honored by observations akin to the funeral games of early
Greece.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">refusal</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Denial
of something desired; as an elderly maiden’s hand in marriage, to a rich and
handsome suitor; a valuable franchise to a rich corporation, by an alderman;
absolution to an impenitent king, by a priest, and so forth. Refusals are
graded in a descending scale of finality thus: the refusal absolute, the
refusal condition, the refusal tentative and the refusal feminine. The last is
called by some casuists the refusal assentive.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">regalia</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Distinguishing

<span class="dialoge">
<p>“What is your religion my son?” inquired the Archbishop of Rheims.</p>
<p>“Pardon, monseigneur,” replied Rochebriant; “I am ashamed of it.”</p>

<p>“In that case, monseiegneur, you should join the Protestants.”</p>
</span>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">reliquary</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
receptacle for such sacred objects as pieces of the true cross, short-ribs of
the saints, the ears of Balaam’s ass, the lung of the cock that called Peter to
repentance and so forth. Reliquaries are commonly of metal, and provided with a
lock to prevent the contents from coming out and performing miracles at
unseasonable times. A feather from the wing of the Angel of the Annunciation
once escaped during a sermon in Saint Peter’s and so tickled the noses of the
congregation that they woke and sneezed with great vehemence three times each. It
is related in the “Gesta Sanctorum” that a sacristan in the Canterbury
cathedral surprised the head of Saint Dennis in the library. Reprimanded by its
stern custodian, it explained that it was seeking a body of doctrine. This
unseemly levity so raged the diocesan that the offender was publicly
anathematized, thrown into the Stour and replaced by another head of Saint
Dennis, brought from Rome.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">renown</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
degree of distinction between notoriety and fame—a little more supportable than
the one and a little more intolerable than the other. Sometimes it is conferred
by an unfriendly and inconsiderate hand.</p>

the two are mae with equal skill the replica is the more valuable, for it is
supposed to be more beautiful than it looks.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">reprobation</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> In
theology, the state of a luckless mortal prenatally damned. The doctrine of
reprobation was taught by Calvin, whose joy in it was somewhat marred by the
sad sincerity of his conviction that although some are foredoomed to perdition,
others are predestined to salvation.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">republic</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
nation in which, the thing governing and the thing governed being the same,
there is only a permitted authority to enforce an optional obedience. In a
republic, the foundation of public order is the ever lessening habit of
submission inherited from ancestors who, being truly governed, submitted
because they had to. There are as many kinds of republics as there are
graduations between the despotism whence they came and the anarchy whither they
lead.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">requiem</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A mass

<p class="entry"><span class="def">revolution</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> In
politics, an abrupt change in the form of misgovernment. Specifically, in
American history, the substitution of the rule of an Administration for that of
a Ministry, whereby the welfare and happiness of the people were advanced a
full half-inch. Revolutions are usually accompanied by a considerable effusion
of blood, but are accounted worth it—this appraisement being made by
beneficiaries whose blood had not the mischance to be shed. The French
revolution is of incalculable value to the Socialist of to-day; when he pulls
the string actuating its bones its gestures are inexpressibly terrifying to
gory tyrants suspected of fomenting law and order.</p>

mystic beverage secretly used by our most popular novelists and poets to
regulate the imagination and narcotize the conscience. It is said to be rich in
both obtundite and lethargine, and is brewed in a midnight fog by a fat which
of the Dismal Swamp.</p>

<p id="rich" class="entry"><span class="def">rich</span>, <span class="pos">adj.</span> Holding
in trust and subject to an accounting the property of the indolent, the
incompetent, the unthrifty, the envious and the luckless. That is the view that
prevails in the underworld, where the Brotherhood of Man finds its most logical
development and candid advocacy. To denizens of the midworld the word means
good and wise.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">ridicule</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Words
designed to show that the person of whom they are uttered is devoid of the
dignity of character distinguishing him who utters them. It may be graphic,
mimetic or merely rident. Shaftesbury is quoted as having pronounced it the
test of truth—a ridiculous assertion, for many a solemn fallacy has undergone
centuries of ridicule with no abatement of its popular acceptance. What, for
example, has been more valorously derided than the doctrine of Infant
Respectability?</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">right</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Legitimate
authority to be, to do or to have; as the right to be a king, the right to do
one’s neighbor, the right to have measles, and the like. The first of these
rights was once universally believed to be derived directly from the will of
God; and this is still sometimes affirmed <i>in
partibus infidelium</i> outside the enlightened realms of Democracy; as
the well known lines of Sir Abednego Bink, following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="poetry">By what right, then, do royal rulers rule?</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">righteousness</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
sturdy virtue that was once found among the Pantidoodles inhabiting the lower
part of the peninsula of Oque. Some feeble attempts were made by returned
missionaries to introduce it into several European countries, but it appears to
have been imperfectly expounded. An example of this faulty exposition is found
in the only extant sermon of the pious Bishop Rowley, a characteristic passage
from which is here given:</p>

<p>“Now righteousness consisteth not merely in a holy state of mind, nor yet in performance of
religious rites and obedience to the letter of the law. It is not enough that
one be pious and just: one must see to it that others also are in the same
state; and to this end compulsion is a proper means. Forasmuch as my injustice
may work ill to another, so by his injustice may evil be wrought upon still
another, the which it is as manifestly my duty to estop as to forestall mine
own tort. Wherefore if I would be righteous I am bound to restrain my neighbor,
by force if needful, in all those injurious enterprises from which, through a
better disposition and by the help of Heaven, I do myself restrain.”</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">rime</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Agreeing

<div class="poem">

Then the domestic dog, to east and west,<br />

<p class="entry"><span class="def">robber</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
candid man of affairs.</p>

<p class="indentpara">It is related of Voltaire that one night he and some traveling companion lodged at a wayside
inn. The surroundings were suggestive, and after supper they agreed to tell
robber stories in turn. “Once there was a Farmer-General of the Revenues.” Saying
nothing more, he was encouraged to continue. “That,” he said, “is the story.”</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">romance</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Fiction
that owes no allegiance to the God of Things as They Are. In the novel the
writer’s thought is tethered to probability, as a domestic horse to the
hitching-post, but in romance it ranges at will over the entire region of the
imagination—free, lawless, immune to bit and rein. Your novelist is a poor
creature, as Carlyle might say—a mere reporter. He may invent his characters
and plot, but he must not imagine anything taking place that might not occur,
albeit his entire narrative is candidly a lie. Why he imposes this hard
condition on himself, and “drags at each remove a lengthening chain” of his own
forging he can explain in ten thick volumes without illuminating by so much as
a candle’s ray the black profound of his own ignorance of the matter. There are
great novels, for great writers have “laid waste their powers” to write them,
but it remains true that far and away the most fascinating fiction that we have
is “The Thousand and One Nights.”</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">rope</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> An
obsolescent appliance for reminding assassins that they too are mortal. It is
put about the neck and remains in place one’s whole life long. It has been
largely superseded by a more complex electrical device worn upon another part
of the person; and this is rapidly giving place to an apparatus known as the
preachment.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">roundhead</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
member of the Parliamentarian party in the English civil war—so called from his
habit of wearing his hair short, whereas his enemy, the Cavalier, wore his
long. There were other points of difference between them, but the fashion in
hair was the fundamental cause of quarrel. The Cavaliers were royalists because
the king, an indolent fellow, found it more convenient to let his hair grow
than to wash his neck. This the Roundheads, who were mostly barbers and
soap-boilers, deemed an injury to trade, and the royal neck was therefore the
object of their particular indignation. Descendants of the belligerents now
wear their hair all alike, but the fires of animosity enkindled in that ancient
strife smoulder to this day beneath the snows of British civility.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">rubbish</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> Worthless
