<h1>D</h1>    
    
<p class="entry"><span class="def">damn,</span> <span class="pos">v.</span> A word formerly much used by the    
Paphlagonians, the meaning of which is lost. By the learned Dr. Dolabelly Gak it is believed to have been a term of    
satisfaction, implying the highest possible degree of mental tranquillity. 
Professor Groke, on the contrary, thinks it    
expressed an emotion of tumultuous delight, because it so frequently occurs in    
combination with the word <i>jod</i> or <i>god</i>, meaning “joy.” It would be with great diffidence that I    
should advance an opinion conflicting with that of either of these formidable    
authorities.</p>    
    
<p class="entry"><span class="def">dance,</span> <span class="pos">v.i.</span> To leap about to the sound of tittering    
music, preferably with arms about your neighbor’s wife or daughter. There are many kinds of dances, but all    
those requiring the participation of the two sexes have two characteristics in 
common: they are conspicuously innocent, and warmly loved by the vicious.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">dawn,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> The time when men of reason go to  
bed. Certain old men prefer to rise at about that    
time, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach, and otherwise    
mortifying the flesh. They then point    
with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe    
years; the truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their    
habits, but in spite of them. The    
reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has killed all

two parts, the day proper and the night, or day improper—the former devoted to    
sins of business, the latter consecrated to the other sort. These two kinds of social activity overlap.</p>

from Boeotia, whence they were driven by stress of starvation, their dullness     
having blighted the crops. For some     
centuries they infested Philistia, and many of them are called Philistines to     
this day. In the turbulent times of the     
Crusades they withdrew thence and gradually overspread all Europe, occupying     
most of the high places in politics, art, literature, science and     
theology. Since a detachment of     
Dullards came over with the Pilgrims in the <i>Mayflower</i>     
and made a favorable report of the country, their increase by birth, immigration,     
and conversion has been rapid and steady. According to the most trustworthy statistics the number of adult     
Dullards in the United States is but little short of thirty millions, including     
the statisticians. The intellectual     
centre of the race is somewhere about Peoria, Illinois, but the New England     
Dullard is the most shockingly moral.</p>
