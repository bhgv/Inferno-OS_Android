<h1>B</h1>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">Baal,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> An old deity formerly
much worshiped under various names.
As Baal he was popular with the Phoenicians; as Belus or Bel he had the honor to
be served by the priest Berosus, who wrote the famous account of the Deluge;
as Babel he had a tower partly erected to his glory on the Plain of Shinar. From Babel comes our English word
&ldquo;babble.&rdquo; Under whatever name worshiped,
Baal is the Sun-god. As Beelzebub he is the god of flies, which are begotten
of the sun&rsquo;s rays on the stagnant water. In Physicia Baal is still
worshiped as Bolus, and as Belly he is adored and served with abundant
sacrifice by the priests of Guttledom.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">babe</span> or <span class="def">baby,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> A
misshapen creature of no particular age, sex, or
condition, chiefly remarkable for the violence of the sympathies and
antipathies it excites in others, itself without sentiment or emotion. There
have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose adventure in the
bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries before doubtless derived
their idle tale of the child Osiris being preserved on a floating lotus leaf.</p>

<blockquote class="poem">

<p class="poind3">The girls were contended.</p>

deity invented by the ancients as an excuse for getting drunk.</p>

<p id="baptism" class="entry"><span class="def">baptism,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> A sacred rite of
such efficacy that he who finds himself in heaven without having undergone it will be unhappy forever.
It is performed with water in two ways by immersion, or plunging, and by aspersion, or sprinkling.</p>

soldiers enjoy a portion of that of which it is their business to deprive others.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">basilisk,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> The cockatrice.
A sort of serpent hatched form the egg of a cock. The basilisk had a bad eye, and its glance was
fatal. Many infidels deny this creature&rsquo;s existence, but Semprello Aurator saw and handled one
that had been blinded by lightning as a punishment for having fatally gazed on
a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved. Juno afterward restored the reptile&rsquo;s
sight and hid it in a cave. Nothing is so well attested by the ancients as
the existence of the basilisk, but the cocks have stopped laying.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">bastinado,</span> <span class="pos">n.</span> The act of walking
on wood without exertion.</p>
