<h1>X</h1>

<p class="firstpara">X in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility to the attacks of the
spelling reformers, and like them, will doubtless last as long as the language.
X is the sacred symbol of ten dollars, and in such words as Xmas, Xn, etc.,
stands for Christ, not, as is popular supposed, because it represents a cross,
but because the corresponding letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of
his name&#8212;<i>Xristos</i>. If it represented a cross it would stand for St. Andrew, who “testified” upon one of
that shape. In the algebra of psychology x stands for Woman’s mind. Words
beginning with X are Grecian and will not be defined in this standard English dictionary.</p>
