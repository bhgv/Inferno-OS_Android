<h1>K</h1>

<p class="firstpara">K is a consonant that we get from the Greeks, but it can be traced away back beyond them to the
Cerathians, a small commercial nation inhabiting the peninsula of Smero. In
their tongue it was called <i>Klatch</i>, which means “destroyed.” The form of the letter was originally precisely that
of our H, but the erudite Dr. Snedeker explains that it was altered to its
present shape to commemorate the destruction of the great temple of Jarute by
an earthquake, <i>circa</i> 730 B.C. This building was famous for the two lofty columns of its portico, one of which was
broken in half by the catastrophe, the other remaining intact. As the earlier
form of the letter is supposed to have been suggested by these pillars, so, it
is thought by the great antiquary, its later was adopted as a simple and
natural—not to say touching—means of keeping the calamity ever in the national
memory. It is not known if the name of the letter was altered as an additional
mnemonic, or if the name was always <i>Klatch</i> and the destruction one of nature’s pums. As each theory seems probable enough,
I see no objection to believing both—and Dr. Snedeker arrayed himself on that side of the question.</p>

<p class="entry"><span class="def">King’s Evil</span>, <span class="pos">n.</span> A
malady that was formerly cured by the touch of the sovereign, but has now to be
treated by the physicians. Thus ‘the most pious Edward” of England used to lay
his royal hand upon the ailing subjects and make them whole—</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="poetry">a crowd of wretched souls</p>
<p class="poetry">That stay his cure: their malady convinces</p>
<p class="poetry">The great essay of art; but at his touch,</p>
<p class="poetry">Such sanctity hath Heaven given his hand,</p>
<p class="poetry">They presently amend,</p>
<p class="poetry">as the “Doctor” in <i>Macbeth</i> hath it. This useful property of the </p>
<p class="poetry">royal hand could, it appears, be transmitted along with other crown </p>
<p class="poetry">properties; for according to “Malcolm,”</p>
<p class="poetry">‘tis spoken To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the gift somewhere dropped out of the line of succession: the later sovereigns of
England have not been tactual healers, and the disease once honored with the
name “king’s evil” now bears the humbler one of “scrofula,” from <i>scrofa</i>, a sow. The date and author of the
following epigram are known only to the author of this dictionary, but it is
old enough to show that the jest about Scotland’s national disorder is not a
thing of yesterday.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye Kynge his evill in me laye,</p>

<p class="poetry">The superstitionth at maladies can be cured by royal taction is </p>
<p class="poetry">dead, but like many a departed conviction it has left a monument of </p>
<p class="poetry">custom to keep its memory green. The practice of forming a line and </p>
<p class="poetry">shaking the President’s hand had no other origin, and when that great </p>
<p class="poetry">dignitary bestows his healing salutation on</p>
<p class="poetry">strangely visited people,</p>
<p class="poetry">All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</p>
<p class="poetry">The mere despair of surgery,</p>
<p class="poetry">he and his patients are handing along an extinguished torch which once was kindled at the
altar-fire of a faith long held by all classes of men. It is a beautiful and
edifying “survival”—one which brings the sainted past close home in our “business and bosoms.”</p>
