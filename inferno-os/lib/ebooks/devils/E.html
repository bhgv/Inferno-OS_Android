<p>Beauty in women      
and distinction in men are alike in this:     
they seem to be      
the unthinking a kind of credibility.</p> 
<p>Women in love are

another with never a thought of its absurdity.     
In the Latin, “<i>Exceptio probat regulam</i>” means that the exception <i>tests</i> the rule, puts it to the proof, not <i>confirms</i> it.

is to enforce the wishes of the legislative power until such time as the     
judicial department shall be pleased to pronounce them invalid and of no     
effect. Following is an extract from an     
old book entitled, <i>The Lunarian Astonished&#8212;</i>Pfeiffer &amp; Co., Boston,     
1803:</p>     
<blockquote>   
<p>Lunarian: Then when your Congress has passed a law it    
goes directly to the Supreme Court in order that it may at once be known whether it is constitutional?</p>     
     
<p>Terrestrain: O no; it does not require the approval of     
the Supreme Court until having perhaps been enforced for many years somebody objects to its     
operation against himself—I mean his client.     
The President, if he approves it, begins to execute it at once.</p>     
     
<p>Lunarian: Ah, the executive power is a part of the legislative.</p>     
     
<p>Do your policemen also have to approve the local ordinances that they enforce?</p>     
     
<p>Terrestrian: Not yet—at least not in their character of constables.   
Generally speaking, though, all laws require the approval of those whom they are intended to restrain.</p>     
     
<p>Lunarian: I see. The death warrant is not valid until signed by the murderer.</p>     
     
<p>Terrestrian: My friend, you put it too strongly; we are not so consistent.</p>     
     
<p>Lunarian: But this system of maintaining an expensive     
judicial machinery to pass upon the validity of laws only after they have long been executed, and then     
only when brought before the court by some private person—does it not cause great confusion?</p>     
     
<p>Terrestrian: It does.</p>     
     
<p>Lunarian: Why then should not your laws, previously to     
being executed, be validated, not by the signature of your President, but by that of the Chief     
Justice of the Supreme Court?</p>     
     
<p>Terrestrian: There is no precedent for any such course.</p>     
     
<p>Lunarian: Precedent. What is that?</p>     
     
<p>Terrestrian: It has been defined by five hundred lawyers     
in three volumes each. So how can any one know?</p>
