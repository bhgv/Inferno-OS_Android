<title>Bill Wattenburgâ€™s Background: Covert Activities?</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Covert Activities?</h1>

<p>We could find no evidence that Wattenburg has ever been involved in government
intelligence or covert activities. We enlisted the services of an investigative firm in Washington,
D.C., whose staff is knowledgeable about the intelligence services. They have reported to us that
their inquiries indicated no knowledge of Wattenburg having any involvement with the services in
the past. However, they pointed out that knowledge of any covert activates would never be
disclosed by their contacts for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>They reported that Wattenburg had been asked by one service to help correct a problem
with Soviet spying on our new embassy building in Moscow, but that Wattenburg had insisted
that anything he did would have to be made public because he was working for ABC. He
evidently made this activity public in the San Francisco Chronicle, April 22, 1987, page 18. The
U.S. State Dept. did not seem too happy with his comments.</p>

<p>We verified that he was in the country during the period 1985 to 1986 for which we had
no information in our 1990 report (see his work on <a href="GoldMine.html">The Gold Mine project</a>).</p>
