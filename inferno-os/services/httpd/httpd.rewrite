# syntax: pattern replacement
# The most specific pattern wins, and is applied once (no rescanning).
# Leave off trailing slash if pattern is a directory.
# Replacements starting with http:// return "Permanently moved" 
# message.
# e.g the following line aliases requests for / to requests for
# /usr/mig/html

# /   /usr/mig/html
